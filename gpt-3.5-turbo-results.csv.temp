"How has the recent heavy rainstorm affected the logging and river navigation infrastructure in the Chippewa Valley, and what are the anticipated changes in operations as a result?","THE LM CROP, Eau Claire, Wis, March 30 A heavy rainstorm, which set in early Saturday morning, followed by moderate weather, has virtually suspended logging operations in the Chippewa Valley, and the camps, with few exceptions, have broken up, after having accomplished a good season's work. The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river. The rivers are all open now, but the dams are frozen to such an extent that logs cannot be run through. On the Wolf, Little Wolf and Waupaca rivers are large crops of logs, and the present season will be a good one for rivermen. The Wisconsin Central Railway is running extra log trains daily, and there is said to be logs enough on their line north of Stevens Point to furnish business for the road all summer. The Weed & Gumaer Manufacturing Company of Weyauwega buys logs from one hundred miles north, saws them at their mills at that place, and re-ships the dressed lumber back to Stevens Point, forty miles north of Weyauwega. There are several new sawmills being erected at the small towns on the railroad, and a lively business will be carried on this summer.",11,gpt-3.5-turbo,Chippewa Valley,Sudden-Onset,Moderate,Constrained,short-term absorptive capacity,transportation,local

Many still stuck to the belief that it would be only an ordinary March blow, but the majority began to doubt this, and made preparations for what they expected would soon turn out to be a fulfillment of Wiggins' warning. Steamers and sailing vessels in the docks were secured to their wharves with extra hawsers, and merchandise in places of insecurity was removed to higher and safer quarters. No remarkable change occurred throughout the following two hours, but about 4 o'clock the wind quickened, gaining strength, light short distance when the storm was at its height, between 8 and 9, but pulled up before getting into danger.

The effects of last evening's storm, reports of the violence of which are now coming in from all parts of Nova Scotia, prove it to have been not so serious as was expected. At the south end of the city part of an old wharf on which the Howell tin-dry was situated was blown away, but the other wharves and property on the water line suffered only slightly. The damage to vessels in the harbor was quite bad, and the heaving up of a few planks in wharves makes up all the other damage yet reported. Vessels at anchor in the harbor rode out the gale without injury. The barometer fell to the highest point known here since the Saxby gale. At eight o'clock it was nearly on a level with the wharves and at nine, when at its highest, the sea washed over in many places, and barrels of flour, meal and other merchandise in exposed places were swept about, but no serious damage, it is thought, has resulted.",11,gpt-3.5-turbo,Nova Scotia,Sudden-Onset,Moderate,Constrained,short-term absorptive capacity,transportation,local

It reads as follows: Gentlemen, I beg to attach you herewith a report of Mr Brittain, recommending the construction of a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke street from Beaudry street to Coteau Neiges road. The construction of this sewer has become necessary by the fact that the city is receiving so many claims for flooding through the overflowing of the Coteau Harron main sewer and the intercepting sewer during very heavy exceptional rain storms. In my opinion these claims should not be entertained for the following reasons: 1. The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then.",11,gpt-3.5-turbo,Unspecified (historical context),Sudden-Onset,Critical,Fragile,short-term absorptive capacity,water,local

The natural conclusion is that the houses must have been built since the sewer was constructed, and therefore, the city should not be held responsible. In regard to the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street, there is only one portion of it which is at present needed during heavy rainstorms, that is between St Lawrence and St George streets. These floodings take place only when there is an exceptionally heavy rainstorm, but these floodings would not have occurred if Westmount municipality, who had the permission of the city to drain their drainage into the intercepting sewer, had abided by the plan which they submitted to the city.",11,gpt-3.5-turbo,Westmount municipality,Sudden-Onset,Critical,Constrained,short-term absorptive capacity,water,local
"What specific action has been proposed to temporarily relieve the flooding on St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, and how does the passage suggest holding the municipalities of Lachine and St Henri accountable for the damages caused to Montreal properties?","I have repeatedly notified the city of their action and have asked the city to allow me to dam the end of our sewer so as to prevent the water coming from Lachine and St Henri doing damage to the properties of the citizens of Montreal, but so far I have received no instructions to do so, and in consequence, the cellars of the properties on that street, and also on the adjoining streets, are nearly always flooded in heavy rain storms; therefore, it is necessary to build this sewer, and the cost of same should be charged to these two municipalities, and I would advise the city to notify them notarially of it. You will note by the agreement between the city and these municipalities that they rendered themselves liable for all damages which they might cause to the city. 3. In order to relieve St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, on the old Coteau Harron main sewer, we can make a temporary relief for these floodings by constructing a sewer on St Catherine street between De Lorimier avenue and Papineau road this autumn.",11,gpt-3.5-turbo,Montreal,Sudden-Onset,Critical,Constrained,short-term absorptive capacity,water,local
What political impact might the delay in the Finance committee's response to the recommendation for the de Levis street intercepting sewer have on the city's infrastructure planning as outlined in Perival W St George's report?,"I would also remind you that a year ago I recommended an intercepting sewer on de Levis street to drain the northeast part of the city; this report has gone before the Finance committee, but we have heard nothing further. It is necessary that this sewer should be constructed in conjunction with the other sewers, which is included in the estimate made by Mr Brittain herewith attached. In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that the Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost.

How did the snowfall and drifting during the blizzard affect the trenches dug by the street railroads for transforming the motive power from cable to electricity?,"There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly. It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist.

How did the heavy snow and sleet specifically impact the operation of the underground trolley lines compared to the cable roads in the city?,"In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable.

An order was sent out from police headquarters to the various precinct commanders to have arrested all persons found alone in a condition that would raise even the suspicion of intoxication. As a result, the police courts today were crowded with eminently respectable looking persons who were let go with a small fine and an admonition to get in out of the snow.

HIT BOSTON, TOO Boston, Mass, November 27. A record-breaking November blizzard swept over the greater portion of New England last night and today, completely demoralizing traffic of every description and well nigh paralysing telegraphic and telephonic communication, while the northeast gale, coming on a high course of tides, drove the sea far beyond its usual limits and made a mark along shore only exceeded by the memorable hurricane of 1801. The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly.

Coming higher than was anticipated, higher than was ever before known, the water reached many houses and business places that made no preparation for such an event, and it was in these that the greatest damage occurred. THE SCENES ON SUNDAY. About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city.

The water extended along to Victoria Square and up to Jurors Street, and even those driving in cabs did not escape without wet feet, for the carriages were nearly up in the shafts. On Honavenltir Street, a little west of Victoria Square, the water suddenly made its appearance and spread along as far as the eye could reach. The street was also submerged from HUGH beyond the American building to some distance past Craig Street. St. Antoine Street was in a similar condition, which was flooded up to St. Maurice Street and the gallery of the Albion Hall was crowded all day by visitors, waiting on the busy street.

One man, having broken up a raft and cast its remnants into the water, was laughing at the predicament he found himself in when he drove into the water, giving a sudden lurch that sent him into the water too. Accidents were numerous in the flooded streets and furnished a source of innocent merriment to onlookers. The district between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, which lies lower than the eastern part of the business section, suffered more, and in some places the water rose to St. Sacrament Street where two merchants were driving brisk trade, conveying merchants and their employees to and from the different stores at exorbitant prices.

Joe Leof's being flooded out, most of his customers could be seen sitting on the doorstep looking disconsolately at the waste of waters, flowing eastwards towards Jarry Park where the bank rises. The water did not extend so far, and people were able to go down as far as Commissioners Street. The ice was not broken up nearly so much as jammed, and presented the appearance of a solid sheet, slightly roughened on top, the only evidences of shifts having taken place being the encumbrance of ice along the revetment wall and the cronkedness of the river roads.

Our country markets have been filling up with cattle and sheep in anticipation of the Christmas demand, while the usual attractive shows and sales of Christmas fat stock have kept many buyers away from Birkenhead, who will, however, probably find their way back after the festive season is over. While the country demand has thus been cut off to a considerable extent, our London customers have been buying pretty strong, the supplies at Deptford for the past ten days having been below the average.

The flood came down in an irresistible torrent, sweeping everything before it and bringing down wrecks and trunks of trees with it. The stream came rushing through the street San Juan de Dios in a wave twelve feet high. Shops were deluged and the contents destroyed. Houses were swept away and their inhabitants drowned or bruised to death. Fifty-seven persons lost their lives. The streets were impassable for a week after the disaster. The damage to property was at least $1,000,000. The pond belonged to a brewer named Nicholas Mena. Panama, September 26. Valparaiso advices of August 18 say the late storms and heavy rains have done much damage. From Serena south there is hardly a place which has not suffered. Houses have been unroofed or otherwise damaged, telegraph wires torn down, railway banks and bridges swept away, towns inundated and general havoc caused. Congress has voted $500,000 for the most pressing necessities of Valparaiso, but that sum is nothing compared with the millions of dollars damage which has been done. Copiapo was inundated and twenty-seven persons were drowned. Traffic on the railroad between Valparaiso and Santiago was suspended for a week.

The insurance bureau began tracking storm costs after the July 14, 1987, flood in Montreal that resulted in payouts of about $70 million. Financial damage from storms before that would have trouble cracking today's Top-50 list because of inflation and Medza said none of the winter ones - including Montreal's so-called ""storm of the century"" in March 1971 - come even close to what this week's will cost. ""I was in this same office I'm in now back in 1971 and I was stranded here for two days,"" he said of the storm that dropped 47 centimeters of snow in Montreal on March 3 and 4 of that year. ""We actually had a pretty good time here. While the streets were blocked and you couldn't go anywhere, you didn't have power failures or tree branches crashing down on cars and homes."" The most expensive winter storm recorded in Canada from an insurance perspective was a March 1991 tornado that tore through Sarnia, Ont., and caused $25 million worth of insurable damage.",11,gpt-3.5-turbo,Montreal,Sudden-Onset,Moderate,Constrained,short-term absorptive capacity,transportation,local
