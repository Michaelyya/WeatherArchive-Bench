"How has the recent heavy rainstorm affected the logging and river navigation infrastructure in the Chippewa Valley, and what are the anticipated changes in operations as a result?","THE LM CROP, Eau Claire, Wis, March 30 A heavy rainstorm, which set in early Saturday morning, followed by moderate weather, has virtually suspended logging operations in the Chippewa Valley, and the camps, with few exceptions, have broken up, after having accomplished a good season's work. The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river. The rivers are all open now, but the dams are frozen to such an extent that logs cannot be run through. On the Wolf, Little Wolf and Waupaca rivers are large crops of logs, and the present season will be a good one for rivermen. The Wisconsin Central Railway is running extra log trains daily, and there is said to be logs enough on their line north of Stevens Point to furnish business for the road all summer. The Weed & Gumaer Manufacturing Company of Weyauwega buys logs from one hundred miles north, saws them at their mills at that place, and re-ships the dressed lumber back to Stevens Point, forty miles north of Weyauwega. There are several new sawmills being erected at the small towns on the railroad, and a lively business will be carried on this summer.","{

No remarkable change occurred throughout the following two hours, but about 4 o'clock the wind quickened, gaining strength, light short distance when the storm was at its height, between 8 and 9, but pulled up before getting into danger. The steamer Sarmatian, from Liverpool, and steamer Newfoundland, from St. John's, Nfld., which arrived this morning, report having felt the blow only lightly, and were caused no anxiety.

What political impact might the delay in the Finance committee's response to the recommendation for the de Levis street intercepting sewer have on the city's infrastructure planning as outlined in Perival W St George's report?,"I would also remind you that a year ago I recommended an intercepting sewer on de Levis street to drain the northeast part of the city; this report has gone before the Finance committee, but we have heard nothing further. It is necessary that this sewer should be constructed in conjunction with the other sewers, which is included in the estimate made by Mr Brittain herewith attached. In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that the Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost.

How does the reluctance of the police to enforce the city ordinance regarding snow shoveling after nine in the morning highlight the political challenges faced by city officials in maintaining consistent sidewalk conditions on Craig street compared to the systemized approach on St. Denis street?,"""You know, or have heard somewhere, that it is AGAINST THE LAW TO SHOVEL SNOW off a tool after nine o'clock in the morning, but then, who ever heard of the police enforcing the city ordinance?

Why should the hard-worked policeman notice an infraction of this law? He might offend an alderman's friend and lose his position.

How did the snowstorm affect the electric car services in the areas west of Toronto according to the passage?,"Sunday evening's despatches brought the news that a very severe blizzard was prevailing in Kansas. This storm has since spread all over the Western states, going as far south as St. Louis, where the phenomenal fall for that latitude of four inches of snow was recorded. Chicago's winds never blew before as they did yesterday and from all points in the Western states come the same reports of unprecedented snowfalls and heavy winds. In Canada the storm, or another, appeared at an early hour yesterday morning, and by six o'clock the electric car services in all the important points west of Toronto had been completely paralyzed. This continent was not alone. The cable reports extraordinarily high winds as prevailing in Great Britain, attended by many shipwrecks, while reports of the same nature come from Europe as far distant as Austria, showing that the European storm was almost as widespread as the American.

It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity.","{

How did the heavy snow and sleet specifically impact the operation of the underground trolley lines compared to the cable roads in the city?,"In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable.

What were the specific impacts of the blizzard on transportation and human health in the regions affected by the recent snowstorm in Great Britain and surrounding areas?,"The recent comparatively mild weather which has prevailed in Great Britain has been interrupted by a thorough blizzard in many parts of the country, especially in the North, where the snowdrifts have been several feet deep.

The Belfast mail boat was twenty hours in making a trip which is usually accomplished in six hours, trains have been snowed up at several places, and, generally, the snowstorm is considered to have been the worst for many years. The severe weather reached as far south as the Mediterranean, where a French transport, bound for Tunis, was obliged to return to Toulon in a damaged condition.

"What specific challenges did Aid Patrick Kennedy and Aid Laurent face regarding snow removal in Point St. Charles, and what economic resources and manpower were already being utilized to address these issues?","ANN H WARD, Aid, Patrick Kennedy asked the chairman of the Road committee if he could kindly send some men and carts out to Forfar and Conway streets, point St. Charles, to have the piles of snow removed. Residents of the locality were put to great inconvenience by the huge piles of snow now accumulated on the streets. He also asked that the snow should be removed from Grey Nun and King streets, as it interfered with the traffic to the merchants' stores. Aid Laurent said that there were mountains of snow all over the city. Already $30,000 has been expended in removing it, and they did not know what to do even now. Seven hundred and fifty men and 450 carters were employed and the Road committee could not please everyone. Aid Kennedy complained that snow and ice taken from the streets should be dumped on St. Patrick's square. He believed some more suitable place could be found than this.

What specific impact did the snowstorm have on the Canada Atlantic train according to the passage?,"Yesterday afternoon one of the boarders came home early and was considerably astonished to find the new man going through a trunk belonging to one of the others. He detained him until the owner of the trunk came in, which he did at 6 o'clock, rather the worse for liquor. On his asking the new man what he was doing in his trunk, the only reply he got was a punch on the nose. A row ensued and the new man was mastered and Chief Detective Cullen sent for. On arrival they wanted the trunk riller to be arrested, but said they would not prosecute, so Cullen refused to make the arrest, the trunk's owner then settled matters by kicking the other man into the street.
