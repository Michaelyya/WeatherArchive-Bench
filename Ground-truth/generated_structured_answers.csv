Harrington, the British military representative in Abyssinia, Menelek is still sitting on the fence, endeavoring to play off one European power against the other. Such a policy is elementary and probable. It is unlikely that Menelek will interfere with Marchand's expedition through his country, and it is equally and even more unlikely that he is meditating the immediate provocation of England. If Menelek's object is to establish a kingdom, any premature trouble with England, he well knows, will spoil this. Meanwhile, British policy is determined that Menelek must stay at home. Under no circumstances will the Abyssinian frontier be allowed to extend beyond the Nile. THE WEATHER Fair, With Stationary or Slightly Higher Temperature Toronto, Ont, November 27.

"""How has the recent heavy rainstorm affected the logging and river navigation infrastructure in the Chippewa Valley, and what are the anticipated changes in operations as a result?""","""THE LM CROP, Eau Claire, Wis, March 30 A heavy rainstorm, which set in early Saturday morning, followed by moderate weather, has virtually suspended logging operations in the Chippewa Valley, and the camps, with few exceptions, have broken up, after having accomplished a good season's work. The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river.  Trains are now running on the Philadelphia and Erie road. Shenandoah, Pa., January 5. The rainstorm throughout this section yesterday and last night was the most severe for a number of years. No less than twelve collieries in the Mahoning Valley are flooded and thrown idle by the rains, and trains on both railroads have been delayed from two to eighteen hours. There are three washouts between Delano and Ashland on the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Some of the flooded collieries are expected to resume operations in a few days, but weeks will be required to remove the water from others. Allentown, Pa., January 5. The water in the Lehigh River was swelled eight feet by the rain of yesterday. Today the city is practically without drinking water and the pumps at the waterworks were flooded and rendered useless. At Bethlehem the water backed into the boiler house of the Bethlehem Iron Works, putting out the fires, and that company was obliged to shut down. The mill will be idle for some time. Hazleton, January 5. Last night's rainstorm did a vast amount of damage throughout this section of the anthracite coal region. Five of the collieries are completely drowned out.  The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then. The natural conclusion is that the houses must have been built since the sewer was constructed, and therefore, the city should not be held responsible. In regard to the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street, there is only one portion of it which is at present needed during heavy rainstorms, that is between St Lawrence and St George streets. These floodings take place only when there is an exceptionally heavy rainstorm, but these floodings would not have occurred if Westmount municipality, who had the permission of the city to drain their drainage into the intercepting sewer, had abided by the plan which they submitted to the city.  The construction of this sewer has become necessary by the fact that the city is receiving so many claims for flooding through the overflowing of the Coteau Harron main sewer and the intercepting sewer during very heavy exceptional rain storms. In my opinion these claims should not be entertained for the following reasons: 1. The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then.

A number of the canal boats were crushed like eggshells and sank in the creek. Never before has such wholesale damage been done in this stream. There were 18,000 barrels of cement stored in the Lawrence Cement Company's mill valued at over $10,000. These are a total loss; it is thought that the loss to the Cornell fleet will be about $40,000. There is no insurance. The loss to the Delaware and Hudson exceeded $5,000. The river continued to rise until 7 o'clock in the morning, when a point twenty-two and a half feet above the low watermark was reached, the water being thirteen feet higher than at noon on Saturday. Since then the water has been receding and no more trouble is anticipated. At Waterford a number of buildings on the bank of the Mohawk were demolished. Everything movable was taken away by the flood. The state dam at Cohoes, which has been condemned this winter by the state engineer, was badly injured. Unless the water recedes before night it is feared the dam will go out. The Champlain Canal crosses the river at this point, and should the dam go out navigation on the canal will be closed the greater part of the summer.""","Chippewa Valley, Wisconsin",4,4,3,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, water",regional,"""The recent heavy rainstorm has significantly affected logging operations and river navigation infrastructure in the Chippewa Valley, causing a temporary suspension of activities.

Oh, in the total, these values are made up from the June schedules of farmers. They show an increase on the figure of last year of $1,000,000 in farm lands, of $500,000 in live stock, $200,000 in implements, and a little over $1,000,000 in buildings, or a total excess over the value of last year of $3,000,000 and of $511,000 over the average values of the five years' period. That certainly does not look as if the farmers of Ontario were suffering from the operation of the National Policy, and the enormous increase in the deposits in the Government and Post Office Savings banks, in the life companies and in the chartered banks are equally conclusive of the prosperity the farmers of Canada have enjoyed in recent years. United States journals, who in ridicule of the claims that the Canadian Northwest is less subject to the visits of the boreal blizzard than their own territories, declared that Winnipeg was the center of the ""banana belt"" of the continent, may read with profit the reports of the climatic condition that now prevail in the two regions.

The passage from Dundee to St John's occupied twelve days and is pronounced by Captain Williams to have been boisterous beyond all his former lengthy experience on the Atlantic. From the time of leaving Dundee until last night the wind blew a tremendous gale, varying from west-southwest to northwest, but abating not one jot in violence. In fact, the Juliet may be said to have been under water for ten complete days.

The range of the gale was from St George's Bay to Bonne Bay.  African countries, in fact, extracted the promise of a desertification treaty at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as the price of their support of other countries on other issues. And so the term desertification hangs on, though its definition was enlarged in Rio to encompass more than human activity as a cause of deterioration of drylands. The definition adopted by the Rio delegates reads: """"Desertification is land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities."""" Definitions aside, Cardy said, the practical issue is what to do about human impact on the drylands, whatever the influence of climate and whether or not the desert is advancing. Some experts say that if the drylands are mostly hostage to climate, it might be best to concentrate resources and effort on improving wetter, more productive lands where the costs would be lower and the returns in terms of agricultural yields would be much greater. """"That's a good economic argument,"""" Cardy said, """"but where are the people who live in the drylands going to go?

The damage to vessels in the harbor was quite bad, and the heaving up of a few planks in wharves makes up all the other damage yet reported. Vessels at anchor in the harbor rode out the gale without injury. The barometer fell to the highest point known here since the Saxby gale. At eight o'clock it was nearly on a level with the wharves and at nine, when at its highest, the sea washed over in many places, and barrels of flour, meal and other merchandise in exposed places were swept about, but no serious damage, it is thought, has resulted.

It first made its appearance northwest of Galva. About 7:30 o'clock two threatening clouds were seen in the west approaching one another, and the tornado is thought to have resulted from their junction. Its course was south and east through that city, and the main body of the storm passed along the main business street of the city. It came with such suddenness that the citizens had no time to fly to places of safety. In the Free Methodist church there was assembled a congregation. In the rink there was gathering a committee to arrange for a Fourth of July celebration. The church was quickly a mass of ruins and the congregation was imprisoned. A number were injured, one dangerously. The rink also was blown down, but those inside managed to escape without injury.  The church was quickly a mass of ruins and the congregation was imprisoned. A number were injured, one dangerously. The rink also was blown down, but those inside managed to escape without injury. Had the storm come a few minutes later many would have been in the building and a loss of life would surely have resulted. The roar of the storm is described as terrible. It was accompanied by an awful sweep of wind that carried everything before it. Nearly every business house along the principal street was unroofed and stocks of goods badly damaged by the floods of water following the tornado. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy roundhouse was a total wreck. G.A. Cole's barn was torn to pieces. When the wind struck Clans Peterson's residence it performed a curious operation, cutting it in two. The storm in the vicinity of Lafayette is said to have been severe, but the damage was less than farther north. It was in the Free Methodist church in Galva that most of those injured were hurt. This old building is in the southeast part of the town. A large congregation was assembled, but on seeing and hearing the storm started out and nearly all escaped.

""""We can share this together, the land and its resources, without destroying it. But they want to use it for their own purposes and never mind the people who live up here. That's not sharing. We call that stealing.""""  But like Masty and Petagumskum, most people retain a strong link with the land and waters that surround them. Thirty Cree families, about one-fifth of the Cree population, spend months in the bush every fall and winter, trapping, hunting and fishing. Others who have jobs in town take advantage of the weekends to stock their freezers with caribou, fish, geese, and other game. The situation is similar for the Inuit, although their activities are concentrated along the coast of Hudson Bay where they fish and hunt seals, beluga whales, caribou and fowl. Robert Brunette, vice-president of Amerindian and Inuit affairs for Hydro, says the road to Great Whale will have a greater impact on the natives than the dams. """"The Cree and Inuit are worried that if roads are open to the general public, people will go hunting and fishing without any control,"""" he said in an interview. One possibility would be to restrict use of the road, he suggested. As for the flooding, the Cree exaggerate the impacts, Brunette said.  They show a pattern of distortions which consistently minimizes the negative impacts of the project. """"A major problem with the present process is that DND had total control over who conducted the study and how it was done. It is common knowledge among the subcontractors that the results of many component studies were never included in the final report, while in other cases results were included only selectively. The consultants involved cannot legally complain publicly and if they did, would gain the unwanted reputation as troublemakers. """"The only checks against such distortions are the public interest groups who were allowed to criticize the report. However, the funding available to them was minuscule compared to that spent by DND. Due mainly to the ability of the Innu to find independent scientists who could critically examine the report, and to the independence shown by the panel, a sham has been exposed. """"But this is not a victory for environmental stewardship and social responsibility. Last Tuesday, for the 10th year, the low-level flights were due to start screaming over the heads of Innu hunters and the wildlife. The EARP process has yet to offer them any real protection.""","James Bay, Quebec",4,5,2,medium-term adaptive capacity,"health, transportation",community,"""The storm caused flooding which affected the infrastructure, particularly roads, in the area.

People along the shore are driven from their homes.  We have now, he says, very complete data for tracing the earth from its original formless or chaotic state through a number of formative and preparatory stages up to its modern condition; but, perhaps, the parts of its history least clearly known, especially to general readers, are those which relate to the beginning and the end of the creative work. In the early stages the monuments are obscure; in the later, they are few, and those few complicated with modern changes under human influence. There are, however, notwithstanding obvious difficulties, facts enough to link the human period to the period that preceded it. The author defines the two latest of the geologic periods as the Pleistocene and the Anthropozoic, the latter being again divided into ""early modern or Pal忙ozoic, sometimes called Quaternary, or post-glacial,"" and the ""Neanthropic"" extending onward to the present time. The Pal忙oanthropic, in Sir William Dawson's opinion, may coincide with ""the ante-diluvian period of human history.""  Clark, who was chairman of the meeting, said the sanctions imposed in the mid-1980s will be lifted only when there are concrete actions, not promises. An External Affairs official said the government stands by its policy and noted that despite the increase in 1990 exports, trade with South Meddling in medicare? Provinces can expect to lose a dollar for every buck residents pay: Beatty BOB COX CANADIAN PRESS OTTAWA Provinces can expect to continue to lose one dollar of federal money for every dollar their residents have to pay in extra medical charges such as user fees, federal Health Minister Perrin Beatty said yesterday. The provisions currently in the Canada Health Act will remain essentially unchanged even as federal payments to provinces for health care disappear, Beatty said outside the Commons. He said Ottawa has a responsibility to enforce national health-care standards. I think that we're seeing pressure at the level of some provinces to challenge the basic assumptions of medicare and that's a real concern, he said. Under the Canada Health Act, Ottawa can withhold health-care money if provinces allow extra billing by doctors or user fees for medical services.  Brode also writes that some of the senior Canadian officers who convicted Meyer may have realized that by making a commanding officer responsible for the actions of his troops—and backing that responsibility with his life—they had written a new page in the rulebook of war. """"There were serious implications to this decision to shoot commanders whose men had breached the laws of war,"""" writes Brode, adding that Vokes aired his concerns about the effects such a ruling could have on commanders """"in any future war."""" Brode also notes that there was evidence—much of it anecdotal, but nevertheless disturbing—that Canadian and other Allied troops may have themselves killed prisoners of war. Some such actions might have been carried out in retaliation for the murders committed by the 12th SS, but other incidents—cryptic references to """"huddles"""" on the beaches of Normandy that occurred before those killings—place those bloody days after the landings in a grim perspective that casts a pale light on both sides of the battle lines. Nor does Brode limit himself to the Normandy killings. Casual Slaughters and Accidental Judgments also examines war-crimes prosecutions for the murder—sometimes by German civilians—of downed Canadian pilots.

Quebec has decided that Hydro should split the environmental review of the Great Whale project so it can start building $600 million in roads and infrastructure before the actual dams and power stations are approved. With Hydro planning to hand the Quebec government its impact study on infrastructure next week, road construction could be under way in three months. """"We're running out of time,"""" said Robbie Dick, chief of the Whapmagoostui band. Whapmagoostui is the Cree name for Great Whale; the Inuit call it Kuujjuarapik. """"I don't want to see violence. I don't want people to get hurt physically in the struggle,"""" Dick said. """"But knowing what happened at Oka and what the government is capable of doing to native people, I don't see how we can stop that."""" Dick, 41, is adamant that taking up arms as Mohawk Warriors did last summer is not the Cree way. Inuit leaders say the same of their people. But Dick has begun consulting his band to determine how far they will take peaceful opposition. One of the first people he turned to was John Petagumskum Sr., a 70-year-old Cree elder.  He concedes that the area to be flooded is not huge compared with the La Grande project, the first phase of James Bay development, which will have swamped 15,000 square kilometres when it is finished in 1996. """"But a lot of affected areas will be concentrated in river valleys,"""" he said. """"The rest of the terrain is rock, and it's pretty hard to have animal habitat there."""" Construction could start in 90 days. When Hydro-Quebec hands the Quebec government its environmental-impact study on the Great Whale roads and airports next week, it will trigger a review process that could lead to road construction in three months. Under the 1975 James Bay agreement, Environment Minister Pierre Paradis must forward the report on the $600-million infrastructure to two committees for study. One committee, set up to review projects that will have impact below the 55th parallel, has two members appointed by the Cree and three by the Quebec government. The other, for projects that have impact above the 55th parallel, has nine members: five appointed by the government and four by the Inuit. Both committees are involved because the effects of Great Whale will be felt on both sides of the 55th parallel.  After last summer's Oka crisis, this vision is enough to make politicians shudder. But as Hydro pushes ahead determined to meet its 1998 deadline for completing the power project and enjoying the Quebec government's blessing, natives in Great Whale, the community most affected by the project, are starting to talk about a showdown. """"Oh yes, we'll be right in the middle,"""" Weetaltuk said this week when asked if she would take part in a blockade natives are considering. James Masty checks a marten trap near Great Whale. To stop the planned road, Great Whale's approximately 500 Inuit and 500 Cree have opposed James Bay II through publicity campaigns in southern Quebec and the United States and through court challenges. But their frustration is growing. Quebec has decided that Hydro should split the environmental review of the Great Whale project so it can start building $600 million in roads and infrastructure before the actual dams and power stations are approved.

and usually it is affected but slightly by a depression that may visit even a large section of the country In 1891, however, it had to seek employment for the great resources at its command at a time when slowness of trade affected all parts, not of the Dominion alone, but of the commercial world There was here no crisis and no financial crash; but everywhere trade was restricted, and the demand for bank accommodation proportionately curtailed Though it is not customary to give information on such matters to the public, it is no doubt the case that to a lack of opportunity for safe employment and diminished rates of interest, and not to losses on account of bad debts, is to be ascribed the falling off in earnings in 1894 compared with 1893, Canada, in the latter year, having, it will be remembered, suffered very little from the commercial calamities that befell her neighbors The annual statement of the Bank of Montreal is always looked for at this period, both by commercial and public men It is an index of the state of trade equal in its way to the national revenue returns Whether from a shareholder's or a public man's point of view the results just announced can be viewed with content It is not minimizing the importance of the efforts of those responsible for the direction and management of the bank's affairs at such a time to say that so satisfactory an outcome could hardly have been obtained in a time of financial collapse or crisis Fortunately it can be said, also, that signs of improving trade are now visible in many quarters, and there is reason to expect that

Fortunately the disaster was not accompanied by fire. The plaster inside was considerably broken and the damage amounts to $6,000. The Damage at Quebec Damage done by last night's storm seems to have been even more extensive than was supposed. The shipping in the Louise Basin suffered considerably. The spars of vessels were damaged and sails torn to shreds and damaged beyond repair. Almost every schooner at the wharves felt the effects of the hurricane. The ship Korwood broke loose from her stern moorings in the basin and had hard work to get back again, assisted by the tugs. The barques Smith and George M. Peak, loading at Commissioners' wharf, drifted out into the stream, taking with them the wharf posts. Both vessels were rescued by the tugs Jones and Victoria. A quantity of timber surrounding the Edith went adrift at the same time. A large portion of it was saved by the tug Three Brothers.  Demurrage was the sum to be paid for delays or detention beyond the fixed number of days for either loading or unloading. His honor was of the opinion that it was damages that the party was entitled to, and not demurrage. The judge in the court below held that he was entitled to £1,000. Perhaps this sum was a little too much, but this was corrected by the allowance for time of loading. The pretension that the time was made up by loading all night could not be sustained because the damages were incurred every day that the ship was delayed. The freighter had no claim for the extra work, for he did it in his own interest. If he had not performed that extra work the damages that he would have had to pay would be greater; it was to reduce the damage that he worked at night. The amount that he put into the vessel that less would be his damages. It was said that the ten days applied to the loading as well as to the unloading. His Honor thought not. Upon the whole case he had come to the conclusion that the damages had been properly allowed, and were not excessive. The result would be that both appeals should be dismissed.  Normally, people who hire other people to work for them are responsible for damages caused by their employees in the normal course of their business Unless, of course, you're the government There is a special law which leaves the city safely protected from all liability caused by the builders or contractors hired by them for the entire duration of the work!  No precise amount was specified, but the approximate quantity was mentioned to the merchants, and price being obtained, a tender was put in by the respondents, and the contract was awarded to them. The appellants, on respondents' order, furnished lumber, and were paid for what they sent. The appellants complained by their action that the respondents had not purchased from them all the lumber mentioned in the approximate statement of quantities, but had obtained elsewhere part of what they required, and the sum of $1,039.91 was claimed as damages. The defense was that the respondents never bound themselves to take any specific quantity, and that they had got all they wanted from the appellants with the exception of a small quantity of a kind which the appellants were unable to furnish. The court below held that there was no contract for a specific quantity, and that the respondents got all they required from appellants with the exception of $39.99 worth which was bought from Henderson Brothers. The purchase from appellants amounted to $34,000, which was duly paid. Under the circumstances, the action was regarded as vexatious and was dismissed. H.

A quantity of timber surrounding the Edith went adrift at the same time. A large portion of it was saved by the tug Three Brothers. On the Louise embankment the wind started several heavily loaded cars and rolled them down the track a long distance before they could be stopped. Along the country roads traces of the storm are visible everywhere. On St. Foy road two large trees on Sleet's farm were blown across the roadway, almost blocking it up. The same thing occurred at the residence of Bissett, on the Charlesbourg road. They had to be removed as they interfered with traffic. In the rear of Bissett's dwelling a barn was wrecked. From other parts of the country come similar reports of destruction, more particularly on the Island of Orleans, where numerous barns and outhouses were brought to the ground.

Valleys Turned Into Seas. The fertile Bear Creek region has not escaped the visitation. Part of the valley has presented the appearance of a turbid sea for days, and communication between its many towns has been almost suspended by the swollen streams. Bear Creek itself has borne along a great deal of wreckage, including fences, outbuildings, and even barns and houses, and has wrought much destruction in undermining and sluicing off the deep alluvium that composes its banks. In the Applegate region, there are few bridges left. Many people were obliged to leave their homes for safety. Great damage has been done to the mining interests of the section by the bursting of dams and reservoirs, the breaking and filling of ditches, and the loss of flume boxes and machinery. The Oregon and California railroad track in Southern Oregon has been washed away for miles, and the roadbed is seriously damaged along the whole line. There has not been a mail either north or south for weeks.  Haulage by the Storm Sunday's storm caused considerable damage at Saint Jerome. Two barns belonging to Messrs. Lajeunesse and Taillon, farmers, were destroyed and the steeple of St. Sophie church was blown down. The previous night fire destroyed the barn of Mr. Alphonse David, of St. Sophie. In this district especially fences were torn down and buildings badly wrecked by the gale. At St. Luc a slight landslide occurred on Saturday night.  THE WEST, Concerning Damage Done in Missouri and Illinois, Little Rock, December 29 Rain has fallen during the past forty-eight hours. Trains on roads leading into the city are delayed. Much of the track of the Iron Mountain road south of the city has been washed away and great damage done to property. Little Rock, Ark, December 29 For several days heavy rains have fallen in this section, the melting snow causing disastrous floods. Thousands of acres of bottom land are under water. Great damage has been done. Fences, bridges, and grain have been swept away and livestock perished. The rain is still pouring and water still rising. Little Rock, Ark, December 29 Ten inches of rain have fallen here since midnight on Monday. The rain is still falling throughout the state. All the rivers and bayous are rapidly rising, many flooding the country for miles. The Arkansas River has risen here since Sunday at the rate of four inches an hour. No trains have run on the Iron Mountain railroad since Saturday night. The tracks are several feet under water in many localities and numerous breaks have occurred. Heavy rainfall is reported along the White River, damaging plantations and doing great damage to crops and livestock.

"""What specific infrastructure damage did the rainstorm cause to the St. John's and Harbor Grace railway, and how long is it expected to take to repair?""","""""BKVKBB RAIN STORM The heaviest storm for many years raged throughout Friday night and Saturday last. Torrents of rain fell causing a rapid melting of the snow. The rivers were swollen to an unprecedented extent, causing great destruction of bridges. The bridge across the upper end of St. John's harbor was swept away. It is expected that the news from the outlying districts will tell of serious damage from flooded rivers. A serious wash-out on the St. John's and Harbor Grace railway occurred between Mannels and Holyrood. Traffic is interrupted and more than a week will be required to make the necessary repairs. The line at this place runs close to the seashore. Perrault's petition to be granted one of the rooms in Bonsecours market for gunstsum was referred to the Market committee.

Valleys Turned Into Rivers and Farms Inundated. Portland, Ore., February 5. Heavy snow storms and rain south of here are causing very great damage to the railroads and telegraphs. The Willamette River, at Portland, has overflowed its banks, and the water is two or three feet deep in the streets of Portland. The Southern Pacific Railway, between Portland and Sacramento, has been practically abandoned for the past two or three weeks. There is great damage to the telegraph lines in all directions, and the Canadian Pacific have the only wires working out of Seattle. The Associated Press despatches from the east were transmitted last night over the Canadian Pacific wires from Chicago, via Montreal, the Western Union having no outlet. The Damage in Oregon. Jacksonville, Ore., February 5. A phenomenal rainstorm has prevailed in Southern Oregon since last Friday, which, in connection with the melting snows in the mountains, has caused the greatest flood known since that country was settled.  Just how long the present condition of things in the river will obtain is, of course, a question open to conjecture. It is quite possible that the water will keep on rising and falling for a considerable time without doing any serious damage. Mr. John Kennedy, chief engineer of the Harbor Board, speaking to a Gazette reporter last night, said that the water had reached its greatest height and would now recede. He did not believe that there would be any flood, and even if the Lake St. Louis ice did come down, at the present time, it would not make any difference. Mr. Kennedy also stated that the harbor fleet, which is moored in the harbor, was quite safe. Matters looked serious early on Sunday morning that some merchants who did not anticipate trouble with the water coming up so far were quite alive to the fact, now that work must be done at once, and quickly, too, although it was Sunday. One firm was that of Thomas Samuel & Son, who had a staff of men at work soon after seven o'clock, removing their large and valuable stock to upper flats.  But he did note that government relief packages have become progressively more generous in recent years. """"For us this is a surprise,"""" he said. """"It's a whole new game.

The $450 million repair bill includes the costs of rebuilding infrastructure like water mains and sidewalks, building new houses and repairing damaged ones, compensating flood victims for furniture and personal effects and providing financial assistance to small businesses. John Burke, a civil protection officer, predicted it could take up to two years to rebuild all the roads, bridges and shorelines in the devastated region. Premier Lucien Bouchard announced a $200 million compensation fund on Monday and has since come up with a more generous relief program. Flood victims who have lost their homes will be reimbursed 100 per cent of the first $100,000 of the municipal assessment value of their homes and 75 per cent of any amount in excess of that.  that's a welcome situation You can increase the power that goes downtown"" The Boucherville-Duvernay line should be reconnected by Jan 21 Once Hydro repairs that line, electricity will be able to flow from Boucherville to the blacked-out Monteregie - the so-called ""triangle of darkness"" Medium-voltage lines in that region are still down, however, and it could take at least two more weeks to repair them Authorities refused yesterday to provide a dollar figure on the damage to the power grid ""I have not received any evaluation of the damage to Hydro-Quebec,"" Caille told reporters Ghannoum estimated that Hydro has lost up to 600 transmission towers and about 30,000 poles The average cost of a tower is $100,000 So it would cost at least $60 million to replace the collapsed towers, not counting the wires and labour involved And Ghannoum suggested that the worst might not be over ""Believe it or not, they are patrolling some lines in some parts of the network to check for more damage,"" he said Caille confirmed the utility is studying some measures to strengthen the grid in the long term ""I have a few answers,"" he said,""",St. John's and Harbor Grace,5,4,3,medium-term adaptive capacity,"transportation, water",regional,"""The rainstorm caused significant damage to the St. John's and Harbor Grace railway, particularly between Mannels and Holyrood, interrupting traffic.

In answer to Aid. Stevenson, he said the report on the number was in course of preparation. The report of the Road committee recommending the erasure of Cote des Neiges bill widening from the homologated line of the city was objected to by Aid. Stevenson and laid on the table till next meeting. The report of the Road committee regarding Water Avenue caused much discussion, and as a compromise was referred to the Road and Water committee. The report of the Road and Finance committees in reference to the contract with Coie St. Louis and St. Louis de Mile End, granting these corporations the privilege of draining into the city sewers, was considered. By the provisions of the report they are prevented from draining slaughterhouse refuse, etc., into the sewers, and they assume all responsibility for damage caused either in the city or in their own limits by flooding. After some discussion, in which it was contended that the report was not accurate enough on some points, it was left over till next meeting, and the City Attorney was instructed to prepare the contract.

Under the 1975 James Bay agreement, Environment Minister Pierre Paradis must forward the report on the $600-million infrastructure to two committees for study. One committee, set up to review projects that will have impact below the 55th parallel, has two members appointed by the Cree and three by the Quebec government. The other, for projects that have impact above the 55th parallel, has nine members: five appointed by the government and four by the Inuit. Both committees are involved because the effects of Great Whale will be felt on both sides of the 55th parallel.  Louis Coktk, Chief Engineer.

In order to relieve St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, on the old Coteau Harron main sewer, we can make a temporary relief for these floodings by constructing a sewer on St Catherine street between De Lorimier avenue and Papineau road this autumn. I would also remind you that a year ago I recommended an intercepting sewer on de Levis street to drain the northeast part of the city; this report has gone before the Finance committee, but we have heard nothing further. It is necessary that this sewer should be constructed in conjunction with the other sewers, which is included in the estimate made by Mr Brittain herewith attached. In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that the Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost.""",Montreal Island,4,3,2,medium-term adaptive capacity,"water, transportation",local,"""The report of the Road and Finance committees has a significant political impact on the relationship between the city and the corporations of Coie St. Louis and St. Louis de Mile End.

No precise amount was specified, but the approximate quantity was mentioned to the merchants, and price being obtained, a tender was put in by the respondents, and the contract was awarded to them. The appellants, on respondents' order, furnished lumber, and were paid for what they sent. The appellants complained by their action that the respondents had not purchased from them all the lumber mentioned in the approximate statement of quantities, but had obtained elsewhere part of what they required, and the sum of $1,039.91 was claimed as damages. The defense was that the respondents never bound themselves to take any specific quantity, and that they had got all they wanted from the appellants with the exception of a small quantity of a kind which the appellants were unable to furnish. The court below held that there was no contract for a specific quantity, and that the respondents got all they required from appellants with the exception of $39.99 worth which was bought from Henderson Brothers.

Gladstone was well known, but since the death of the great statesman Her Majesty has given several proofs of her kindly regard for Mrs. Gladstone, the widow. She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks.

The appellants complained by their action that the respondents had not purchased from them all the lumber mentioned in the approximate statement of quantities, but had obtained elsewhere part of what they required, and the sum of $1,039.91 was claimed as damages. The defense was that the respondents never bound themselves to take any specific quantity, and that they had got all they wanted from the appellants with the exception of a small quantity of a kind which the appellants were unable to furnish. The court below held that there was no contract for a specific quantity, and that the respondents got all they required from appellants with the exception of $39.99 worth which was bought from Henderson Brothers.

For them, a blizzard occurs when blowing-snow conditions are accompanied by intense cold a wind-chill factor of 1875 watts per square metre. That's the equivalent of minus-40 C.

A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all today.  An inspection of the premises was then made. It was evident that the burglars had taken their time, for glasses and decanters were lying around in a state of great disorder. The safe seems to have been carried bodily from its place, as there were no marks of the castors along the floor as there would have been had it been moved in the usual way. This naturally led to the conclusion that there must have been a number of men engaged in the burglary. The detective afterwards proceeded with Mr. Dorais to the ice, where, about a mile from the hotel, just opposite the city limits, they found the safe battered about, as described by the farmer. The contents of the safe, consisting of upwards of $300 in cash, besides some notes and securities, were missing and the safe itself was smashed almost beyond recognition. Lying around the safe were found some sledgehammers and a number of other heavy tools, which, it was subsequently discovered, had been stolen from a blacksmith's shop at Hochelaga. The entire detective force was at once put on the affair, with the result that four men were arrested in the afternoon at 1504 St. Antoine street.""",Urban and suburban areas (specific location not specified),4,5,3,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, infrastructure","local, community","""The snowstorm caused significant disruption to infrastructure, particularly transportation, with stock trains arriving late and covered in snow, and mail trains delayed or not arriving at all. The Leland hotel also suffered damage with a window being blown in, although it was quickly boarded up to prevent further damage."""
"""How did the snowstorm impact train operations and human health in the areas mentioned, particularly in terms of accidents and emergency services?""","""African countries, in fact, extracted the promise of a desertification treaty at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as the price of their support of other countries on other issues. And so the term desertification hangs on, though its definition was enlarged in Rio to encompass more than human activity as a cause of deterioration of drylands. The definition adopted by the Rio delegates reads: """"Desertification is land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities."""" Definitions aside, Cardy said, the practical issue is what to do about human impact on the drylands, whatever the influence of climate and whether or not the desert is advancing. Some experts say that if the drylands are mostly hostage to climate, it might be best to concentrate resources and effort on improving wetter, more productive lands where the costs would be lower and the returns in terms of agricultural yields would be much greater. """"That's a good economic argument,"""" Cardy said, """"but where are the people who live in the drylands going to go? As populations grow, are we going to say that because it's tough we'll turn our backs on them? It doesn't make sense.  ""Public opinion has underestimated just how drastic and severe these phenomena are, and it has brought it home to people better than a million political speeches."" The floods have had a domino effect. Train travel around much of Britain, already in chaos after a spate of accidents forced officials to cut train speed and to begin an emergency repair program, is now an improvisational prospect at best. On any given day, huge swaths of track might be closed for repairs. Some sections might be covered in water. Others might be littered with leaves and tree branches. And others might be buried in sludge. It has been doubly difficult for passengers because the train companies do not seem to know day by day, or even hour by hour, which services will be disrupted or for how long. ""Has this put people in a bad mood?"" asked a ticket agent at Victoria Station in London the other day, as the voice on the loudspeaker announced that the train to Gatwick airport had suddenly been canceled because of ""speed restrictions"" on the line. ""Everyone's always in a bad mood anyway, but now they finally have a reason.""  He would not reveal who was on the teams except to say they are emergency specialists. ""There is only one tactical team, dubbed the department's own SWAT team, for now."" Statistics made public by the Health and Social Services Department yesterday show occupation rates for emergency beds dropped from 1985 to 1988, but have increased since then despite the continued cash injections. For example, the occupation rate for beds in Montreal increased from 91 per cent to 97 per cent during 1988. Yet Cote believes 80 per cent of emergency-room patients don't belong there and could be better treated in out-patient clinics, community health clinics, or private clinics. Those areas stand a better chance of getting more money, he said. Cote said he wants to create an emergency system in which funding needs are based on cold statistics and efficient management, not how well one region is able to lobby the government or how loud they scream. ""It's with an instrument like this that we'll be able to give each region and sub-region (the service) it has the right to,"" he said. The Parti Quebecois, meanwhile, said the Liberals were playing for time and using the investigating teams as a smoke screen instead of addressing the heart of the problem.

Blame budget woes: hospitals JEFF HEINRICH THE GAZETTE Hospital officials and watchdogs yesterday blamed budget problems and school holidays not mismanagement for staff shortages this week that have closed 1,000 of 11,000 beds in the Montreal region. Only in rare cases has mismanagement led to shortages, said Marcel Marion, who regulates bed closings for the Montreal Regional Health and Social Services Council. Marion rejected Health Minister Marc-Yvan Cote's suggestion yesterday that poor management has led to chronic emergency-ward overcrowding, contending most hospitals have streamlined operations in recent years to become more efficient. Jacques Maynard, who heads the 300-bed Cite de la Sante Laval Hospital in Laval, said 60 people were brought in to emergency yesterday ""and we have a capacity for only 32."" Forty-five beds have been closed.  Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind.

FAIRAVISATIIUR TODAY. Yesterday's Storm Gone to Sea Lower Temperatures Probable. Toronto, December 20, 11 p.m. The depression which was over Lake Superior last night had by morning developed into a most severe storm, central in the Ottawa valley, and has since moved to the Bay of Fundy. A heavy westerly gale has prevailed all day in the Lake region, and a northeast snowstorm along the St. Lawrence from Montreal eastward. Snow and rain are falling in the Maritime provinces.  Right now, Birrell says, developers are willing to discount by 15 to 20 percent on rents, which typically range between $25 and $34 a square foot for class A space. The relative glut of new office space will push Montreal's vacancy rate up to 13.3 percent, Birrell figures, still lower than in Toronto but sharply higher than this city has seen in several years. The development industry moves in cycles of feast and famine. Last year was a lean year, with few new projects delivered and the vacancy rate on class A space tumbled to 4.8 percent by the end of December. But over the next two years, there will be more supply than the market can absorb. Another complicating factor is the rising cost of relocation. Rental rates on new office space have moved up considerably from those charged in the late 1980s. """"This is a factor that has affected virtually every major Canadian city during the past three years,"""" says Birrell of Devencore. The increase is a direct result of higher land prices and the rising cost of construction and financing. And costs could move even higher once the goods-and-services tax takes effect next year.""",New York City,4,3,2,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, food",local,"""The severe snowstorm has significantly affected the transportation infrastructure in New York City, causing disruptions and accidents due to poor visibility and harsh conditions.

""""But a lot of affected areas will be concentrated in river valleys,"""" he said. """"The rest of the terrain is rock, and it's pretty hard to have animal habitat there."""" Construction could start in 90 days. When Hydro-Quebec hands the Quebec government its environmental-impact study on the Great Whale roads and airports next week, it will trigger a review process that could lead to road construction in three months. Under the 1975 James Bay agreement, Environment Minister Pierre Paradis must forward the report on the $600-million infrastructure to two committees for study. One committee, set up to review projects that will have impact below the 55th parallel, has two members appointed by the Cree and three by the Quebec government. The other, for projects that have impact above the 55th parallel, has nine members: five appointed by the government and four by the Inuit. Both committees are involved because the effects of Great Whale will be felt on both sides of the 55th parallel.  African countries, in fact, extracted the promise of a desertification treaty at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as the price of their support of other countries on other issues. And so the term desertification hangs on, though its definition was enlarged in Rio to encompass more than human activity as a cause of deterioration of drylands. The definition adopted by the Rio delegates reads: """"Desertification is land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities."""" Definitions aside, Cardy said, the practical issue is what to do about human impact on the drylands, whatever the influence of climate and whether or not the desert is advancing. Some experts say that if the drylands are mostly hostage to climate, it might be best to concentrate resources and effort on improving wetter, more productive lands where the costs would be lower and the returns in terms of agricultural yields would be much greater. """"That's a good economic argument,"""" Cardy said, """"but where are the people who live in the drylands going to go?

"""How did the snowfall and drifting during the blizzard affect the trenches dug by the street railroads for transforming the motive power from cable to electricity?""","""There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly. It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity.  In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable. Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile.

IN CANADA, Yesterday's Storm Paralysed all the Western Ontario Towns. TORONTO, February 12. The snow storm here was one of the worst recollected by the average citizen. The streetcar service was badly blocked early in the afternoon and electricity gave way to horse power in the outlying lines. Unchanged street electric cars were kept running with difficulty all day. Drifts were formed in many streets to the depth of several feet. Trains coming into the city were very late. Meetings announced for the evening were in every case very thinly attended, and the streets were empty tonight. No damage in the city is reported from the storm at present. ST. CATHARINES, February 12. A terrific wind and snowstorm has prevailed here most of the day and is still raging. The electric street railway car line is knocked out and traffic generally demoralized. LONDON, LONDON, Ont, February 12.  Notwithstanding this precaution on the part of the police, there were a number of casualties, including several deaths from exposure. HIT BOSTON, TOO Boston, Mass, November 27. A record-breaking November blizzard swept over the greater portion of New England last night and today, completely demoralizing traffic of every description and well nigh paralysing telegraphic and telephonic communication, while the northeast gale, coming on a high course of tides, drove the sea far beyond its usual limits and made a mark along shore only exceeded by the memorable hurricane of 1801. The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly. There was not a railroad in New England that was not more or less tied up by the storm.""",New York and Boston,5,5,2,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, energy","local, regional","""The blizzard caused high exposure and sensitivity due to the extreme snowfall and drifting, which filled up the trenches dug by the street railroads for transforming the motive power from cable to electricity. The adaptability was low as the street cleaning department, with its limited resources, struggled to clear the snow, and the trolley lines were inoperative all day."""
"""How did the heavy snow and sleet specifically impact the operation of the underground trolley lines compared to the cable roads in the city?""","""In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable. Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile.  AT OTHER POINTS Hartford, Conn, November 27. The storm in this city is the heaviest known since the blizzard of 1888. The snow is about two feet on a level, and is drifted badly. Trains on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad were much delayed. The train from New York Saturday night reached here at 4 o'clock this afternoon, 14 hours behind time. Trolley travel has been entirely suspended during the day, but some short lines are being cleared up this evening. John A. Horn, an electrician, was killed on the Glastonbury line this morning while working at clearing the track. He was shifting the trolley bar when he was struck by a snow plow. Nyack, N.Y, November 27. A storm raged through Rockland County last night and today, doing much damage. The snow drifts are from three to seven feet high, and have made traveling through the county impossible on some roads.

"""What specific impact did the snow have on the mail train from Boston and subsequent mail delivery as reported by the superintendent of mails in the general Post Office?""","""Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile. Suburban traffic was blocked for several hours in the morning and after that trains ran at long intervals. All trains were delayed. Some that were due in the early morning hours had not been heard from at night. The superintendent of mails in the general Post Office reported that the mail train from Boston, due at 6 a.m., had not been heard from, nor had the mails been received up to 10 o'clock tonight. The incoming mails from other parts, he said, were from two hours to an unknown number of hours behind time. The damage to small shipping in the harbor and down the bay was very great. It is reported tonight that several tug boats belonging to the Kingston Towing Company, together with a large number of canal boats, were sunk up the river by the force of the gale. The shores of the Hudson are littered with wreckage. At 9 o'clock this morning a fleet of twenty-two ocean-going steamships were anchored in the bay.  Not over two inches of snow has fallen at any point, and loggers are having serious trouble in the woods. No serious cases of suffering are reported. The cold is moderating rapidly. West Sitka, Wis., December 27, The cold snap last night did not moderate today, and a sharp wind made traveling disagreeable. The thermometer was at 22 below zero at 1 p.m., and is still falling. Chicago, December 27, Towards evening the train service on the northern and western roads improved rapidly and tonight the post office officials report mails from most sections of the country arriving about on time. On the eastern roads, however, the situation is not so favorable. All trains from that direction are from one to three hours late and one train is reported leaving Cleveland for Chicago seven hours late. Omaha, December 27, A blizzard came upon this state last night. At various points the temperature marked 12 to 24 degrees below zero, and light snow fell late last night. The mercury dropped 31 degrees in 24 hours, and tonight it is growing colder.  Plunkett, who is now gone a fortnight, is said to be in Boston.

Grimsby, March 20. Mr. Graham of the Montreal & Toronto Railway. The snowstorm of last night and this morning has interrupted railway communication. Two mail trains are fast in the sand at Three Rivers. The English mail per S.S. Circassian, at Halifax, and the western mails per Grand Trunk were delivered here at 4:30 p.m. The storm is said to be the worst of the season. The Lower Town Street Railway Company carried more passengers last year than in any year since they have been running. The Quebec Chess Club meets tonight for the purpose of arranging a return match with the Toronto Chess Club. Mr.  The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day. All the roads suffered, both the eastern and western trains being from one to eight hours late. The driving snow made signals on the railroad tracks practically useless, and caused a collision between two freight trains on the West Shore tracks near 97th street and Stoney avenue about noon. Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind. In spite of the fearful weather and the condition of the streets the ambulances were kept busy a large part of the day. BLOOMINGTON, Ill., February 12. A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all today. The snow is ten inches on a level, and is badly drifted. Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. INDIANA, FORT WAYNE, February 12.  The protection afforded by the buildings of the town reduced the sensible force of the blizzard considerably, but a few farmers who fought their way in from the country reported the storm to be one of terrible severity. Chicago, January 22. Although no snow fell in the vicinity of Chicago today, the drifting of very fine snow was such as to make railroading very hard and to delay trains. The same state of affairs, from dispatches received by the railway mail service, exists in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the signal office predicts that tomorrow's mails from the West and Northwest will be from ten to fifteen hours late.

Fifteen and a half below is reported from Anniston, Alabama. IN BOSTON Boston, Mass, February 13 There is a regular old-fashioned snowstorm which has been raging throughout New England since early Sunday morning increased in intensity today and by night had developed into a blizzard with the usual accompaniment of stalled railroad trains, paralyzed streetcars and a general blockade. The storm, following the severe cold wave of last week, seems to have been a fitting climax for the severest weather that has been experienced in this region for many years. The main storm began at an early hour this morning and since then it has snowed incessantly, while the northwest gale at times reached a velocity of over 60 miles an hour. The steam railway companies wrestled all day with great drifts but by night the train service was practically suspended throughout New England.  Here are some examples of what is affected: A man illegally detained in police cells or wrongfully arrested on insufficient evidence. A landlord who sees police damage one of his apartments during a raid. An improper police response worsens damage caused by a riot or a thief. Pearl gave an example in which he represented merchants who successfully sued police after the 1993 Stanley Cup riots. Police had reacted slowly when hordes of rioters looted stores along St. Catherine St.  ""It's a big problem. One of our big worries is that people will go home, find that they have no money and eat whatever is left over even if it might be rotten,"" said Project Genesis worker Gary Saxe. ""There's one family that has electricity at home but is staying here (at the shelter) just to have dinner,"" Saxe said. Like many local community workers, Mehrabi believed the freezing rain and power outages have been devastating for West End residents on low incomes. This is because many local welfare recipients are just finding out about emergency measures taken by the Quebec government in response to the situation, after what advocacy groups call a difficult wait. The province is currently issuing emergency cheques and payment guarantees to welfare recipients who have lost food during the storm, said Pierre Baraby, a spokesman for the Ministry of Employment and Solidarity. The amount of emergency aid is to be determined by welfare agents on a case-by-case basis, he said. A spokesman for Montreal's Revenue and Securities Department, Roch Corriveau, said these measures are allowing recipients to purchase food at stores with the guarantee that the province will compensate merchants later.  The new bridge was expected to be operating after midnight, emergency measures spokesman Debbie Rudderham said. Weather forecasters weren't offering any immediate relief from the wet weather. The same three low-pressure systems that drenched the industrial Cape Breton area with nearly 200 millimetres of rain between Oct. 28 and Thursday continued. An additional 33 millimetres fell Thursday, seven millimetres Friday and 52 millimetres Saturday. Between 5 and 10 millimetres were expected yesterday. Environment Canada meteorologist Mike Battson said no more heavy rainfall was in the forecast, but the system will continue to provide regular amounts of rain (from five to 20 millimetres) until mid-week. Woman shoved into path of train EDMONTON - A 22-year-old woman was shoved into the path of an approaching transit train yesterday but escaped death when the train was able to stop without hitting her.

Havoc to Quebec's Electric Wire, From our own correspondent, Quebec, November 29. The Quebec & Levis Electric Light Company are perhaps the heaviest sufferers from yesterday's storm. Yesterday afternoon the lofty trim towers recently erected on Dorchester bridge for carrying the electric light wires into the city were blown over into the River St. Charles on the upper side of the bridge. With them were blown down all the poles of the Electric Light Company from the bridge to Hedlryville. The loss to the company will be very large. These towers were supposed to be exceedingly firm and strongly built. They were 110 feet in height. The city was in darkness last night and must remain so tonight also. The manager on hearing the news of the accident notified the electrician at the Falls and instructed him not to turn on any of the dynamos.  He replied that he was unable to believe that the provost-marshal had been guilty of the monstrous and inhuman conduct charged against him. He said an immediate inquiry would be made, and if the story proved to be true, exemplary punishment would be meted out to the provost-marshal. VINCINC.

The floods have had a domino effect. Train travel around much of Britain, already in chaos after a spate of accidents forced officials to cut train speed and to begin an emergency repair program, is now an improvisational prospect at best.

And others might be buried in sludge. It has been doubly difficult for passengers because the train companies do not seem to know day by day, or even hour by hour, which services will be disrupted or for how long.

It was not clear whether the controller thought the pilot was dead or that his radio had gone dead. The FAA made no comment about the tapes.

The service in the churches of this city yesterday were all well attended and were peculiarly devotional in their nature, as was appropriate to the day. All the Roman Catholic churches were suitably draped in purple, and the voice of devotion was subdued and somewhat sad, soon to rise in a tone of joy and praise on Easter Sunday. The day was everywhere observed as a holy day throughout the city, and not so much as a holiday.

B, April 9, St. John today experienced the worst April snowstorm it has known for thirty-four years. The streets were blocked and business largely suspended. The storm, which began about midnight Sunday, raged with unabated fury all day. The air was full of snow, which was whirled into drifts five and ten feet deep. The schools suffered severely, and the few scholars that turned out were sent home at the noon hour. Over sixteen inches of snow fell during the day and it was of that wet kind which stuck wherever it touched. All attempts to clear the sidewalks were abandoned towards nightfall as useless. Tonight it is colder with a high wind. The street railway did not have a car out, and the Bay of Fundy and Boston steamers did not leave their moorings. The Short Line railway did not send out any trains, but the other railroads are running fairly well on time.

Montreal gets such a pure and dur blizzard less than once a year. SNOWSTORMS They come at us from two main directions: the Canadian West and the U.S. East Coast. Western storms usually bring dry snow; coastal storms give us wet snow, excellent for making snowmen.  The recent comparatively mild weather which has prevailed in Great Britain has been interrupted by a thorough blizzard in many parts of the country, especially in the North, where the snowdrifts have been several feet deep. Three men perished in the snow in the Highlands, a train was blown off the rails near Tralee, Ireland, numbers of fishing boats have been lost, many fishermen have perished, and the Irish mail boats and cross-channel mail services were interrupted or seriously delayed. The Belfast mail boat was twenty hours in making a trip which is usually accomplished in six hours, trains have been snowed up at several places, and, generally, the snowstorm is considered to have been the worst for many years.

She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks.

He declared that the visit of the Queen to Cannes would be an insult, and he expressed the hope that Her Majesty would have more tact than to provoke a demonstration of ill-feeling by her presence on French territory at the present moment, when, he adds, Great Britain is doing her best to humiliate France. These outbursts on the part of the French newspapers are having a certain effect, and letters are appearing in the English newspapers urging that pressure be exercised in the proper quarters to induce the Queen not to go to the French Riviera, but to go to Florence instead.

Most are letting their passengers re-book without penalty, but the chaos of the last couple of weeks makes this a good time to review what your rights as a traveler are, as opposed to what the airlines are willing to do for you as a goodwill gesture. To know who is entitled to what, we must first examine the kind of contract and the type of product. A full-fare airline ticket on a regularly scheduled carrier is almost always fully reimbursable. APEX tickets or any other reduced fare tickets might have a cancellation or change-of-date penalty, but it's usually not very much. SEVERE RESTRICTIONS Charter flights and packages are very different. In exchange for a lower price, severe restrictions apply. These may, in cancellation cases, equal the total purchase price. Such severe penalties are valid on the condition that the traveler was made aware of them when he bought the ticket or package.

B, February 10, Yesterday's heavy snowstorm blocked almost every branch railway in the province and seriously interfered with the trunk lines. To-night a furious gale is blowing in St. John and throughout this section of New Brunswick with the mercury down below zero. The snow is drifting into large piles and is filling up railway cuttings faster than the ploughs can be operated against it. A train which left Fredericton yesterday morning only reached here to-night, and between Fredericton and Woodstock several passenger trains are stalled by the snow. Reports from many parts of the province state that this last snowfall has practically put an end to operations in the lumber woods, the snow being too deep for hauling. There is much suffering in many districts, through the highways being impassable for teams, the food supply for both animals and man being very short. Despatches from St. Stephen to-night state that the Canadian Pacific railway branch to that town is totally blockaded and like reports have come in from St. Andrew's. So far the Intercolonial has got through much better than its great competitor. The Kent Northern railway management is trying to dig through twenty-seven miles of snow drifts.

"""How did the six-inch snowfall affect train schedules in the city according to the passage?""","""Conflicting totals are products of measuring methods The city of Montreal and Environment Canada use different ways to estimate snowfall, That often leads to conflicting totals like those announced after Montreal's first two major storms, Montreal says the city gets an average of 231.5 centimetres of snow every year, while Environment Canada says it's 217.5 centimetres, Here is a look at the different snow-measuring methods: The city As city of Montreal workers hosed water onto a rink across the park, Michel Frenette unlocked a 3-metre-high chain-link gate topped with barbed wire, It protects one of the city's best-kept secrets, Inside is a contraption that resembles a large, old-fashioned milk can topped by an upside down bell, They are held in place by steel wires fastened to the ground; more wires and cables connect the device to a small concrete shed nearby The facility, in Rosemont's Lafond Park, is part of a little-known network city officials refer to as ""the Montreal Triangle"" - three snow-measuring stations the city has been running since 1978, The others are in Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Sud-Ouest boroughs, Montreal pays Enviromet International, a private company, $180,000 a year to measure snowfall at the stations, Each captures falling snow in a snow gauge containing antifreeze (to ensure snow melts instantly and to keep the liquid from freezing) and oil (to prevent liquid from evaporating), said Frenette, who works for the city department that coordinates centralized aspects of Montreal's snow-clearing operations, Atop the snow gauge sits a conical device that reduces wind turbulence that can affect the amount of snow captured, The snow gauges constantly measure the weight of the liquid, information is then sent to the nearby shed, where a computer calculates the snowfall.  The commuter GO Train canceled service for the weekend so tracks could be cleared and readied for tomorrow morning's rush hour. Via Rail was on a modified schedule along the Windsor-Quebec City corridor over the weekend and had fewer trains running. Officials are hoping good weather will mean the schedule would be back to normal by tomorrow. Pearson International Airport had no delays or cancellations yesterday, officials said. While the roads and rails are being cleared, panicked Torontonians whose roofs are leaking or caving in under the record snowfall are swamping roofing contractors' phone lines. Warmer temperatures over the weekend caused the massive snow loads accumulated over the last two weeks to begin thawing, turning them into heavy loads that strained roofs and overflowed eavestroughs. Residents in a row of five townhouses in the city's west end had no time to call a roofer early yesterday before being awakened by the terrifying sound of the roof and outer walls collapsing under the weight of snow. No one was injured but damage to the houses was severe. Bedrooms and living rooms were bared to the elements when the structures collapsed.  But the leaves of other spring bulbs which had put in an appearance, like tulips and narcissus, are quite tough. MINOR DAMAGE They've been exposed to freezing temperatures before. They will most likely just sit out the snowfall until it melts, and then continue growing. The tips of a few leaves might have been burned by the cold, but the damage should be minor. And it's probably the same story for the perennial plants that were reviving after the winter. The leaves of some of them sit there under the snow all winter anyway, and they were just perking up and showing fresh colour before the snow fell. They should be tough enough to tolerate a little snow cover for a few days. The only ones that might show a bit of damage to the tips of their leaves are things like bearded irises, which had already grown a few inches out of the ground. But this shouldn't affect their blooming this summer. Now that we're over the initial shock of seeing so much snow in April, believe it or not, there is a positive side to this snowstorm. Dave Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada, says that when all the snow melts it will give the soil some much-needed moisture.  Nick Pompeo, a professional snow-buster in the city, had been ready to retire his plow and truck out his lawnmower. """"This snow is like an unwanted pregnancy,"""" he said in rather unorthodox terms. """"You deal with it, but it leaves you pulling out whatever hair you have left. It's so bloody depressing."""" On that note, I called a mental-health professional for counseling. I asked how Montrealers could be expected to cope with this sudden turnaround. She said she wished she could help but she, too, felt like leaping out of a high window when she saw all the snowfall. Concerned her remarks might be misconstrued, she then advised folks to focus on warm thoughts instead. Yeah, that should do it. OK, she countered, it could be worse - we could be on the verge of another divisive referendum campaign. When reminded that Premier Bouchard had recently been hinting of just such a development, she suggested I consult another mental-health pro. In fact, it could be worse. According to my trusty Canadian Weather Trivia Calendar, residents of Riviere du Loup had a heck of an April back in 1876. Millions of flies fell during a snowstorm.  As the water receded during the dry winter months, pools formed in the sawgrass prairie, concentrating fish in abundant quantities. Wading birds, wood storks, herons, and ibises depended on the pools to provide them with food and timed their nesting cycles accordingly. But human manipulations have forever disrupted that essential cycle. While rainfall still provides the remaining Everglades with most of its water, levees and canals have segmented the vital """"sheet flow.""""

Nolan stirred up a little storm by asking why St. Ann's ward was not represented on the inundation committee. Aid. Wilson and Germain moved that the names of Aid. Nolan and Stevenson be added, and this caused more trouble. Aid. Nolan having complained of being struck off the committee, Aid. Conroy asked what right Aid.

"""What specific impact did the snowstorm have on the Canada Atlantic train according to the passage?""","""The battery, as it will probably be called, will be devoted to garrison purposes, the barracks will probably be erected at Esquimalt, where the celebrated dry dock is located, and where the British naval squadron in the Northern Pacific calls for coal. Not a train has left or arrived in Ottawa all day, both the Canada Atlantic and Canadian Pacific railway lines being blocked. The Canada Atlantic was cleared this afternoon, but just afterwards an engine and snowplough ran off the track, renewing the blockade. The city council this evening appointed a deputation to wait upon the Ontario Government concerning the school of practical science, which it is asked, should be established in this city in connection with the Provincial Normal School.  Much credit is due to the conductor, the engineers, and the other officials of the train for the manner in which they acquitted themselves under the circumstances, the opinion of all being that it was one of the worst storms they ever had experienced. Many of the shovellers were completely exhausted; in fact, some of them were so fatigued that they were unable to work when the last snow-drift was reached. The snow in several places blew into the railway cut almost as fast as it was shovelled out. ON THE CANADA ATLANTIC, matters were not much better. The trains which left the city on Friday did not reach Ottawa until early Saturday morning. The early train from Ottawa on Saturday was cancelled or rather its departure was delayed until eleven o'clock, when the conductor expressed a belief that he would make the usual time to Montreal. Everything went well as far as Glen Robertson, the track being clear and the regular time limit being observed. At that point it was ascertained that the train which left Montreal in the morning was stuck a short distance west of St. Polycarpe. The train going east got orders to meet it, and, if possible, help it through.  It has caused a general snowfall, turning to sleet and rain in the southern portion of the Lake region, and is now causing snow throughout the St. Lawrence. Owing to another depression now forming off the Atlantic coast, a snowstorm is prevailing in the Maritime provinces with strong winds and gales. The storm signals ordered for Maritime ports yesterday morning will be continued. St. Lawrence: Cloudy with snow followed by clearing weather; higher followed by lower temperature. A GREAT SNOWSTORM. Yesterday's snowstorm was the heaviest for many years, the amount registered at McGill observatory up to 11 p.m. being over twelve inches. This naturally had a disastrous effect on the punctuality of trains from all over the country, particularly to the west, dispatches bringing word of delays of from three to twenty hours, many trains in Western Canada, especially the locals, being cancelled. The country roads in the majority of cases are completely impassable, and it will take several days to get them into good condition again. Several freight and one or two passenger trains are reported stuck in drifts on the Grand Trunk railway and Canadian Pacific railway lines in Ontario.  It came on suddenly, but the people were more prepared for it, and the loss was consequently not so serious. Numbers of cattle, however, perished, and the people, especially the sick, suffered much. The loss by both floods is estimated in aggregate at about $12,000. The people whose property has been damaged are said to be well off and it will not be necessary to adopt any measures for their relief. SNOWSTORM YESTERDAY: A heavy snowfall for April delayed trains. Yesterday the city and district were visited by a severe snowstorm which would have been more seasonable in January or February than in the month of April when people are anxiously looking out for the springtime. The snow fell heavily all day and vehicular and pedestrian traffic was impeded to a large extent. The streets were pretty much deserted and what with the war news and the storm business was very dull. The trains coming into and leaving the station were remarkably well on time. The Canada Atlantic, due from Ottawa at 11:35 a.m., was only thirty-five minutes behind. No. 4 east, due at 12:02 p.m., was twenty minutes late. The Delaware & Hudson and Central Vermont trains were on time.  Allan, Murray, Torrance and other shipping firms, are moving in the matter of obtaining an increase of the Harbour Police, and a memorial to that effect will be prepared and forwarded at an early date to the Minister of Marine. The merchants claim that there is an evident necessity for increased protection this year, as, aside from the announced intention of the ship laborers to hold out for higher wages and their determination not to give in to their demands, which may result in trouble, the accommodation of the harbour is being increased and the force at its present strength is not adequate to the protection of the shipping along the extended line of wharves. Trains Delayed. The heavy snowstorms of the last day or two have seriously impeded the train service, and most of the trains have been greatly delayed. The Western yesterday morning was six hours late, and the New York trains on the Vermont Central and Delaware & Hudson, about three hours. The Ottawa train on the Canada Atlantic, due at 8:55 on Monday evening, did not arrive until 8 o'clock yesterday morning.

There were about three feet of water on St. Paul Street, as far as the Custom House Square. From conversation with several proprietors of stores on this street, it was learned that the loss will not be nearly as much as last year, as they had not put much time in the blasting operations and had prepared for the worst. At Young Street police station there were three feet of water on the floor. There were five boats stationed here and the police were kept busy all day in transporting parties to and from their work. Turning along Commissioners Street numerous large ice floes were encountered, and it was impossible to get past the Custom House. The Examining Warehouse and the Harbor Commissioners were flooded to a depth of several feet and the Custom House was in a like plight. Two forlorn looking individuals were standing on the wooden sluice at the pumping station.

PAUL STREET, between McGill and St. Francois Xavier Street, where the level is very low, was soon covered, it flowing into the cellars of the stores alone, filling them, coming as high as the window sills in some cases. Carts and express wagons were brought into requisition, and such goods as were exposed to danger and had not already been ruined were removed, some to higher ground and others to the upper storeys. On H'ALL STREET the water came up past St. Ann's market, which was surrounded, though the floor was not reached, and no damage was done in the battle of the building. The cellars, as well as those along Foundling and Grey Nun streets, were filled. So also were those in the blocks to the south. The Custom House stood like an islet and the clerks had to make their way out in carts and cabs. The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix.

Conflicting totals are products of measuring methods The city of Montreal and Environment Canada use different ways to estimate snowfall, That often leads to conflicting totals like those announced after Montreal's first two major storms, Montreal says the city gets an average of 231.5 centimetres of snow every year, while Environment Canada says it's 217.5 centimetres, Here is a look at the different snow-measuring methods: The city As city of Montreal workers hosed water onto a rink across the park, Michel Frenette unlocked a 3-metre-high chain-link gate topped with barbed wire, It protects one of the city's best-kept secrets, Inside is a contraption that resembles a large, old-fashioned milk can topped by an upside down bell, They are held in place by steel wires fastened to the ground; more wires and cables connect the device to a small concrete shed nearby The facility, in Rosemont's Lafond Park, is part of a little-known network city officials refer to as ""the Montreal Triangle"" - three snow-measuring stations the city has been running since 1978, The others are in Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Sud-Ouest boroughs, Montreal pays Enviromet International, a private company, $180,000 a year to measure snowfall at the stations, Each captures falling snow in a snow gauge containing antifreeze (to ensure snow melts instantly and to keep the liquid from freezing) and oil (to prevent liquid from evaporating), said Frenette, who works for the city department that coordinates centralized aspects of Montreal's snow-clearing operations, Atop the snow gauge sits a conical device that reduces wind turbulence that can affect the amount of snow captured, The snow gauges constantly measure the weight of the liquid, information is then sent to the nearby shed, where a computer calculates the snowfall.""","Montreal, Canada",4,4,3,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, water",local,"""The flood severely affected the operations at the Custom House and the transportation methods used by the clerks to exit the building.

"""How did the flooding impact the operations and infrastructure of the police and fire stations in the affected area?""","""After last summer's Oka crisis, this vision is enough to make politicians shudder. But as Hydro pushes ahead determined to meet its 1998 deadline for completing the power project and enjoying the Quebec government's blessing, natives in Great Whale, the community most affected by the project, are starting to talk about a showdown. """"Oh yes, we'll be right in the middle,"""" Weetaltuk said this week when asked if she would take part in a blockade natives are considering. James Masty checks a marten trap near Great Whale. To stop the planned road, Great Whale's approximately 500 Inuit and 500 Cree have opposed James Bay II through publicity campaigns in southern Quebec and the United States and through court challenges. But their frustration is growing. Quebec has decided that Hydro should split the environmental review of the Great Whale project so it can start building $600 million in roads and infrastructure before the actual dams and power stations are approved. With Hydro planning to hand the Quebec government its impact study on infrastructure next week, road construction could be under way in three months. """"We're running out of time,"""" said Robbie Dick, chief of the Whapmagoostui band.  He concedes that the area to be flooded is not huge compared with the La Grande project, the first phase of James Bay development, which will have swamped 15,000 square kilometres when it is finished in 1996. """"But a lot of affected areas will be concentrated in river valleys,"""" he said. """"The rest of the terrain is rock, and it's pretty hard to have animal habitat there."""" Construction could start in 90 days. When Hydro-Quebec hands the Quebec government its environmental-impact study on the Great Whale roads and airports next week, it will trigger a review process that could lead to road construction in three months. Under the 1975 James Bay agreement, Environment Minister Pierre Paradis must forward the report on the $600-million infrastructure to two committees for study. One committee, set up to review projects that will have impact below the 55th parallel, has two members appointed by the Cree and three by the Quebec government. The other, for projects that have impact above the 55th parallel, has nine members: five appointed by the government and four by the Inuit. Both committees are involved because the effects of Great Whale will be felt on both sides of the 55th parallel.  But their frustration is growing. Quebec has decided that Hydro should split the environmental review of the Great Whale project so it can start building $600 million in roads and infrastructure before the actual dams and power stations are approved.

"""How did the flood, caused by the breaking-up of ice above the Lachine Rapids, specifically impact the infrastructure and human activities at the Point police station and the fire station on Centre Street?""","""At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water. There were of course many incidents, some of them laughable, some of them sad, connected with the flood. Men and boys constructed rafts and paddled round on them; express wagons were in use as ferries and conveyed loads of waiting people, men and women, to their homes, not a few of which were partly under water. Large crowds of people collected in the affected districts and stood in groups watching the water as it slowly crept up, bearing with it blocks of ice, which stranded on the street as it would ebb for a short time, only to return with greater volume within a comparatively short period. The chief cause of the flood was doubtless the breaking-up of the ice in the reaches above the Lachine Rapids. At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore.  The stores were all closed, and those proprietors who had been fortunate enough to secure their sidewalks had manufactured them into floating pontoons. The floor of No. 4 fire station was quite under water. The scene was an animated one, with boats and canoes carrying people from their residences to terra firma, and express wagons carrying whole families. The water was all around. THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY STATION, but these standing high were at 4 o'clock quite dry. The track at the Lachine depot was quite under water, and it was learned that the cars had been removed and that trains would start from Fulford Street. In St. James Street, the water had penetrated and was pouring down Little St. Antoine and Little Craig Street, into Craig Street proper. At the Chaboillez Street police station were a number of boats, and the police, under the superintendence of Sergeants Kehoe, Carboneau, and Beattie were doing their best to render assistance to the imprisoned families. Rowing along Notre Dame Street the reporter's boat met with its first accident by running into a horse and nearly knocking it over, and many were the oaths vented on the heads of the oarsmen.  The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water.  P. and Mr. Desjardins, M.P., are getting the members representing the counties affected by the flood to wait upon the Government to urge them to take immediate steps to deal with the matter. The police of No. 9 station reported at 3 o'clock this morning that the water had risen about an inch within the hour. In cellars flooded from the Craig street tunnel also a slight increase in height seemed noticeable. The omnibus service on St. Antoine street has been resumed, the horses being driven through the water. The Notre Dame street route is broken near Chaboillez square, and the Point St. Charles service is discontinued altogether. The Richelieu & Ontario company's officials state that the ice on the Richelieu river is coming down quietly, and that the company's boats have sustained no damage. It is expected that one of the Quebec boats will be here by the 2nd of May. A rumor was prevalent in the city last evening to the effect that two men had been arrested at St. Gabriel while attempting to open the sluice gates and let the water in upon Point St. Charles. The rumor could not be traced to any reliable authority.  5 THE DISASTROUS INUNDATION, Mater Rising Last Night at Point St, Diaries, DISTRIBUTING AID TO THE SUFFERERS Bridges Swept Away in the Quebec District, HOODS UP THE OTTAWA RIVER, A Man Drowned in the Storm-Several Firms Lost, Heavy Loss-The Business of Trade Has Been Disrupted, There has been no material change in the river since Saturday morning, for while the water would suddenly drop at one time it would quickly rise shortly after, and at a certain point last night the condition of affairs was very alarming, The leaving reached the highest point and steadily rising, The suffering among the poorer classes of Point St. Charles is very great and will not end immediately the subsidence, as it will take some time to have the houses thoroughly dried, and a situation serious as this may still All day Saturday the Point was the center of attraction for sightseers from the city and boats were in great demand, The price of passage was always above par and those lucky enough to be the happy possessors of boats did a rushing business in the passenger transport trade, The police in that district have been worked almost to death rowing people about from place to place, Some of them have been on duty for from 24 to 48 hours on stretches and have not received any remuneration, nor are they likely to, They have also been engaged the whole time in the laudable work of supplying provisions and fuel to the THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS, and they were much annoyed by crowds of individuals who, knowing that the police boats were free, hailed them on every occasion and with all sorts of excuses merely for the purpose of having a row through the flooded district for no other purpose than to satisfy their curiosity, But very little change was observable in the submerged portion of the city all day Saturday from the state of affairs already published in the Gazette, At noon the water was about ten inches lower than on the previous night, It then began to rise again until the evening when in front of the city it stood at 18 feet 0 inches, The appearance of the river changed very little, and with the exception of an open space of water above the bridge and another opposite St. Helen's island, nothing could be seen but huge piles of hammock ice, At an early hour on Saturday night about six full loads of ice came down from Lake St. Louis, and failing to force its way much further than the foot of the Lachine rapids, jammed against the edge of the stationary ice where it remained, thus closing up the space of open water, At the waterworks the hydraulic machinery was stopped by the """"backwater"""" caused by the rise in the tail-race, and all the steam engines had once more to be set to work, At the wheel house the water was sixteen feet above its usual level, The water is deepest on Centre, Magdalen, Grand Trunk and Favard streets, while on Wellington street from the bridge west to Turner's grocery store the depth of the water is on the average about five feet, Although the inconvenience of the residents of the Point has been very great since the commencement of the flood, no real suffering was experienced until Saturday, when it began to be much felt by the poorer residents of Magdalen and Centre streets, most of whom were completely shut up in their houses, unable to obtain the ordinary necessaries of life, A great many of these depend on their month's pay for their supplies, and pending this payment they have accounts at the grocery and butcher shops, and were without the ready cash to send to the city for what they needed, and as nearly all the places of business at the Point are submerged, and the contents either ruined or seriously damaged, the condition of these families is painful in the extreme, Alderman Tausey has been indefatigable in his endeavors to help the sufferers, and has done everything in his power to alleviate their distress in the way of purchasing and distributing provisions, but the number of boats at the disposal of the police at the Point is altogether inadequate for the task in hand, The members of the police force at No. 1 station are nearly worn out from overwork, and the authorities should engage both more men and boats to work in the relief of the distressed citizens, All day yesterday thousands visited the deluged district, and the boatmen again had a bonanza, The police boats were engaged from early morning distributing bread, meat and fuel, The condition of things is now terrible, and still the waters continue to rise, in the police station there is now about two feet of water on the main floor, although the station is on high ground, Fences, outhouses, etc., are floating about in all directions, and the bodies of fowls and other small animals are to be seen also floating in many places, THE LOSSES, No estimate that will come at all near the correct result can be made of the losses of the sufferers by the flood, but the fact is certain that every resident at the Point will lose in a greater or less degree by this serious disaster, Among the principal losses so far as known are Messrs. Pillow & Hersey, who had 15,000 casks of nails stored in their manufactory on St. Patrick street; their loss is estimated at $10,000, The Messrs. Ogilvie lose a large quantity of flour, and the Grand Trunk are also heavy losers, and they have issued posters notifying their employees that the workshops at the Point will be closed until the 1st of May in order to repair damage done by the flood, Mr. Harry Lomas will also be a heavy loser, as not only the basement, but also the parlors of his fine hotel have been flooded, The Point St. Charles school buildings are all more or less damaged, as are also the Methodist and Grace churches, NOTICE, Most of the houses in St. Lambert are deserted, the inhabitants having taken refuge either inland with their more fortunate neighbors, A large number of cattle have been drowned and thousands of bushels of grain destroyed, In Papineau things are in about as bad a condition, and the trains have been stopped, The water rose suddenly when the lake ice came down, and it is reported that considerable damage was done, but nothing reliable was ascertained, The farmers were all prepared beforehand, and most of them had removed their cattle, Several houses in La Tortue are reported to have been carried away, causing loss of life in some instances, but in this case also nothing definite has yet been learned, The water is rising fast at Ottawa, and it is feared the boats of the Ottawa River Navigation Company will be damaged, The bridge over the North river between St. Jerome and St. Adele has been carried away, also the railway bridge at St. Lin, Reports of similar accidents have come in from different places, The New York train was started out Saturday evening via Moore's Junction, and the Boston train by way of the Southern Eastern, The rising of the waters again yesterday, however, will interfere with the trains today if they do not recede, On Saturday afternoon a man was standing on the gallery of his house on Shearer street, gazing wistfully over the waste of waters, thinking mournfully of that little game of draw he was to have had with his neighbor over the way, when a cow came sailing past, A brilliant thought struck the genius, and he inveigled the animal near enough to the house to get on its back, and boldly set sail for the other side of the street, The bovine, however, had no interest in the game and was deaf to the allurements of the lack pots in perspective, so she stubbornly persisted in wending her weary way down the street, The gallant rider protested with his heels, but the fiery untamed was determined and finished up by discharging his rider into the swollen stream, whence he emerged a wetter and wiser man, On Saturday a horse attached to one of Mr. Clarke's field beef wagons strayed into a yard in rear of the Leahy property on St. Patrick street, and came very near drowning before he could be extricated from the wagon and taken to a place of safety, From one o'clock yesterday until eleven o'clock last night the water in the flooded districts had made a further rise of two and a half feet, AT LACHUTE, Messrs. C. Wilson & Co. have received the following telegram from Lachute: White's bridge is gone, Lane's bridge is broken, Fish's and Harron's bridges are in danger of going at any moment, The bridge on the West river is also gone, The North river was never known to be so high, the depth of water going over the paper mill dam eight feet thick, Last night, a mile below Lachute, Bannerman's flume and Karl's dam were washed away, Point Fournaise, April 25, The river is very high here and bids fair to rival the flood of 1870, The inhabitants were aroused at an unusually early hour this morning by ice from above the dam coming down, displacing in its course three guide piers and carrying away nine booms, Reaching the village it wrecked the wharves, scattered cord wood, dislocated a stable and a storehouse and coming in contact with the ice here, which is still firm, it created a great jam, which naturally increased the height of the water at this point, Water street east is flooded, and the inhabitants are moving, The steam ferry Nil Desperandum, which has been completely rebuilt, has taken shelter in Water street, Grain had to be removed from the granaries, Further damage from ice and rising water is feared, Business is at a standstill, CLEAR WATER AT QUEBEC QUEBEC, April 25, This morning the ferry company's three steamers commenced breaking up the ice bridge, moving in every direction, The whole mass moved down with the ebb tide, and the river from the Grand Trunk depot, south of Quebec, downward will be clear of ice tomorrow and the ferry service resumed on Monday, Quebec, April 28, A strong blow from the east set in last night, breaking up another large portion of the ice-bridge to a point a little below Cap Rouge, Large masses of ice are held stationary opposite the city by the strong wind, The water is covered with an immense quantity of saw logs and other lumber, which has evidently been carried down the Etchemin and Chaudière rivers by the floods, Numbers of men are out on the ice picking up the driftwood.""",Point Police Station and Fire Station on Centre Street,5,5,2,short-term absorptive capacity,"water, transportation",local,"""The flood caused by the breaking-up of ice above the Lachine Rapids severely impacted the infrastructure and human activities at the Point police station and the fire station on Centre Street.

"""What specific infrastructural damage was caused by the moving ice and accompanying flood in the area between Vaudreuil and St. Johns, and how does this compare to the flood of 1861 in terms of economic and ecological impact according to the passage?""","""At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore. The mass, with the accompanying flood, piling up on an already jammed front of the city, continually aggravated the trouble, till the flood in Montreal exceeded anything in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, surpassing, it is estimated, by several feet that of the year 1861. The Lachine Rapids have obliterated, so high has the river risen. The country for miles on the south side of the river was covered. From the mountain top, far as the eye could reach, nothing could be seen on the south but a vast expanse of water spreading over the country. Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered.  The next rise in the river will occur in about a month, when the waters from the wood come down. This usually occurs between the 24th May and the 1st June. A FLOOD CATASTROPHE, So many of Montreal's spring floods have occurred in the month of April that, after the fashion of """"Old Moore's Almanack,"""" a calendar prepared for Montreal might well bear the stereotyped phrase in the month named, """"About this time look out for flood;"""" thus, for example, we have April 18, 1836; April 14, 1861; April 4, 1878; April 27, 1885; April 17, 1880, and a few others of which we have not the exact data at hand. Our object at present is to recount an accident which occurred on Monday, April 18, 1898, during the flood of that year. The following disaster, caused by an ice shove on that day, occurred on Common street, a little west of Port street, just above Kilbride's. The whole family was overwhelmed.  At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water. There were of course many incidents, some of them laughable, some of them sad, connected with the flood. Men and boys constructed rafts and paddled round on them; express wagons were in use as ferries and conveyed loads of waiting people, men and women, to their homes, not a few of which were partly under water. Large crowds of people collected in the affected districts and stood in groups watching the water as it slowly crept up, bearing with it blocks of ice, which stranded on the street as it would ebb for a short time, only to return with greater volume within a comparatively short period. The chief cause of the flood was doubtless the breaking-up of the ice in the reaches above the Lachine Rapids. At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore.  With regard to the latter, he said the insufficiency of blasting operations had been clearly demonstrated, and had also the fact that floods in Montreal were due to the premature breaking up of the upper ice. It had also been proved beyond the possibility of a doubt that the only way to prevent floods in the future was to retain the upper ice, by means of a boom, until the channel below was clear and a passage attained. This undoubtedly was a Government work, and as Parliament was now in session, no time should be lost, as if a grant were not made this session a grant next session would be too late to prevent a flood next year.  Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street.""",Area between Vaudreuil and St. Johns,5,5,2,short-term absorptive capacity,"water, transportation",local,"""The moving ice and accompanying flood caused significant infrastructural damage, including the destruction of wharves and buildings close to the shore.

As millions of Chinese citizens engage in an epic battle to hold back the still-rising floodwaters of the mighty Yangtze River, another battle also is being waged, to hold back the truth about the human toll being exacted by the worst flooding in nearly 50 years. Foreign journalists have been denied permission to visit flood-stricken areas, and journalists attempting to visit without permission have been detained. Chinese media make no mention of disasters, preferring to focus on individual tales of heroism, such as that of a handicapped man dubbed ""the human sandbag"" by newspapers because he used his body to protect a hole in a dike. The government has announced with precision the number of hectares of farmland inundated (21.5 million), the number of houses destroyed (5.58 million), and the number of sandbags (2 million) and wooden piles (7,800) being deployed to protect dikes in one particular county in Inner Mongolia, also affected by flooding.  He concedes that the area to be flooded is not huge compared with the La Grande project, the first phase of James Bay development, which will have swamped 15,000 square kilometres when it is finished in 1996. """"But a lot of affected areas will be concentrated in river valleys,"""" he said. """"The rest of the terrain is rock, and it's pretty hard to have animal habitat there."""" Construction could start in 90 days. When Hydro-Quebec hands the Quebec government its environmental-impact study on the Great Whale roads and airports next week, it will trigger a review process that could lead to road construction in three months. Under the 1975 James Bay agreement, Environment Minister Pierre Paradis must forward the report on the $600-million infrastructure to two committees for study. One committee, set up to review projects that will have impact below the 55th parallel, has two members appointed by the Cree and three by the Quebec government. The other, for projects that have impact above the 55th parallel, has nine members: five appointed by the government and four by the Inuit. Both committees are involved because the effects of Great Whale will be felt on both sides of the 55th parallel.

It reads as follows: Gentlemen, I beg to attach you herewith a report of Mr Brittain, recommending the construction of a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke street from Beaudry street to Coteau Neiges road. The construction of this sewer has become necessary by the fact that the city is receiving so many claims for flooding through the overflowing of the Coteau Harron main sewer and the intercepting sewer during very heavy exceptional rain storms. In my opinion these claims should not be entertained for the following reasons: 1. The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then.

It is impossible at the present time to form any estimate of the damage that has been done on the flooded streets. It would be easier to say who had not than who had suffered.

THE SCENES ON SUNDAY. About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city. The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat.  The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat. The water extended along to Victoria Square and up to Jurors Street, and even those driving in cabs did not escape without wet feet, for the carriages were nearly up in the shafts. On Honavenltir Street, a little west of Victoria Square, the water suddenly made its appearance and spread along as far as the eye could reach. The street was also submerged from HUGH beyond the American building to some distance past Craig Street. St. Antoine Street was in a similar condition, which was flooded up to St. Maurice Street and the gallery of the Albion Hall was crowded all day by visitors, waiting on the busy street. There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous.  St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St. Urbain and Cote Streets were also submerged, and boats and rafts were plying here and there. The Central Fire Station on Craig Street was also invaded, and in a few moments the men's bedroom was under water and everything soaking. EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED DISTRICT. At 11 o'clock the water extended up St. Urbain Street, about fifty yards above Craig Street and from Craig up Alexander Street to Vitre, remaining the same; on Cote Street it was up to the Theatre Royal, and rose as high as the hubs of carriage wheels on Vitre, between St. George and Chenneville. On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George.  The stores were all closed, and those proprietors who had been fortunate enough to secure their sidewalks had manufactured them into floating pontoons. The floor of No. 4 fire station was quite under water. The scene was an animated one, with boats and canoes carrying people from their residences to terra firma, and express wagons carrying whole families. The water was all around. THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY STATION, but these standing high were at 4 o'clock quite dry. The track at the Lachine depot was quite under water, and it was learned that the cars had been removed and that trains would start from Fulford Street. In St. James Street, the water had penetrated and was pouring down Little St. Antoine and Little Craig Street, into Craig Street proper. At the Chaboillez Street police station were a number of boats, and the police, under the superintendence of Sergeants Kehoe, Carboneau, and Beattie were doing their best to render assistance to the imprisoned families. Rowing along Notre Dame Street the reporter's boat met with its first accident by running into a horse and nearly knocking it over, and many were the oaths vented on the heads of the oarsmen.  He had more trouble on the way back. Carrying the boys made his movements slower and heavier, his response to danger less prompt. Yet he brought the boys back safe and sound. The crowd did not cheer, but sighed relief. Joe Vincent rendered other public services besides saving lives on the river. In 1886 the spring flood overflowed the city as far up as Victoria Square. The fire department faced a problem. Fires at times broke out in the flooded area. The horse-drawn fire reels, if they got into the really deep water, began to float and tended to topple. Vincent solved the problem. To be on hand for any emergency he slept at the Central Fire Station. He had brought boats on express wagons. They stood ready. Shortly before 3 o'clock on the morning of April 23, fire broke out on Shearer St. Firemen responded but came to a halt when water deepened.

Witnesses said about 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers crossed the border to reinforce Israeli troops in the zone.  The festivities actually began just seven seconds into the game when Chris Nilan and Rob Ray exchanged unpleasantness. Two minutes later, Brad May received a double minor for spearing. You have to call five minutes and a game there, said Savard. The official wasn't calling the penalties. We had to do something. Savard took the law into his own hands with time running out in the second period. He and Hawerchuk fought. Savard figured it was the first time he had dropped his gloves since early in his 12-year career. When the playoffs come around you have to respond to challenges, he said.

"""How did the flooding impact transportation and commerce between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, and what unique business practices emerged as a result?""","""There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous. One man, having broken up a raft and cast its remnants into the water, was laughing at the predicament he found himself in when he drove into the water, giving a sudden lurch that sent him into the water too. Accidents were numerous in the flooded streets and furnished a source of innocent merriment to onlookers. The district between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, which lies lower than the eastern part of the business section, suffered more, and in some places the water rose to St. Sacrament Street where two merchants were driving brisk trade, conveying merchants and their employees to and from the different stores at exorbitant prices. Quite a number of men were seen with rubber boots up to their thighs trudging through the water, rather than pay fifty cents for a seat of 200 or 300 feet. But in St. Paul Street and the adjacent districts the water was far too deep for pedestrianism.  During the evening the police while out in a patrol boat noticed a man named Kenny taking a barrel of oil on a raft along Wellington street. As he could not give a satisfactory explanation as to where he had got it they arrested him. It was afterwards ascertained that it had been taken from Messrs. Chaput & Co.'s store, corner of St. Peter and Commissioners streets. A gentleman who had just returned from Lachine last evening stated that the Lake St. Louis ice had commenced to come down about 5 o'clock, which will probably account for the sudden rise in the water about that hour. Reports from Beauharnois state that the ice is breaking up there and coming down. The telegraph wires in many directions are down, however, and no accurate information can be obtained. THE SHOVE FOLLOWED BY A BLOCK AND A FLOOD, Thuri Rivers, April 23, The ice which floated away from Grondines and Peschambault yesterday, blocked at Port Neuf and the river, which fell rapidly during that shove, is now rising again. The streets are flooded and families in the lower portion of the town are flitting to their friends on the higher lots.  The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water.  Their way of life is compromised as a result.

He praised the helicopter pilots who have carried out rescue operations since the flooding began last Friday night. In La Baie, the Saguenay's hardest-hit community, crews using heavy machinery worked round the clock to repair the devastation. During an afternoon press conference, local officials issued a final tally of the effects of the disaster, which killed two children and destroyed 199 houses and 13 businesses. Another 216 residences were heavily damaged and 4,500 people moved out. Officials said at least 2,500 evacuees will be unable to return to their residences for more than two weeks. For some returning residents, the devastation was too much to bear. One crying woman buried her face in her husband's chest.

Emergency funding City makes aid available to help welfare recipients buy food ALLISON LAMPERT Special to The Gazette Loading stacks of microwave dinner-like trays into a van, Multi-Caf worker Fred Mehrabi is thrilled that the community food bank, for once, has too much food. The Cote des Neiges based organization helped feed residents of the 400-bed Centre de Loisir Communautaire - the area's largest shelter. ""Today there's a surplus, tomorrow who knows,"" Mehrabi said as he transported the food back to the depot. Mehrabi anticipated the demand for food among people with low incomes would grow dramatically as they return home from shelters to refrigerators filled with spoiled food. ""It's a big problem. One of our big worries is that people will go home, find that they have no money and eat whatever is left over even if it might be rotten,"" said Project Genesis worker Gary Saxe. ""There's one family that has electricity at home but is staying here (at the shelter) just to have dinner,"" Saxe said.

""At least the house is still there."" An Ultramar gas station, a convenience store and a caisse populaire were among the neighborhood businesses that were washed away. Some residents grumbled when authorities were unable to tell them when they will be able to return home. ""There isn't any running water or electricity,"" one man said. ""It could be two more days or two more weeks before I can come back.""  Flood victims were able for the first time yesterday to pick up at banks an advance of $2,500 per household as part of a federal-provincial $200 million financial-aid package. Ottawa also is planning exceptional measures to provide unemployment insurance to people who have lost their jobs because of flood damage to stores and factories, federal Labor Minister Alfonso Gagliano announced yesterday during a tour of the region. Transport Quebec has reopened most main roads and Bell Canada has restored about half of the 26,000 disconnected phone lines.

I believe we should be spending much of that time and money closer to home. By doing a little research and experimenting, we can effectively create """"country-ish"""" settings right in our own backyards. So while we cannot replace lost wetlands or return suburbs to their natural state, homeowners can encourage backyard wildlife and give them a safe place to live. First, we must understand that all forms of life have four basic requirements: shelter, food, water and enough space to provide the first three items. The trick to encouraging backyard wildlife is learning what combinations are needed for the species you wish to persuade to stay. A top priority is making your lawn """"toxin-free"""" by eliminating the use of pesticides and herbicides, regardless of your chosen species. Not only do these chemicals destroy many valuable and beneficial species, they also accumulate with disastrous results in the food chain of birds and other animals. Now, about the bugs in your life.

"""What specific impacts did the flood have on the infrastructure between Craig and Vitre Streets, and how did residents adapt to these conditions?""","""St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St. Urbain and Cote Streets were also submerged, and boats and rafts were plying here and there. The Central Fire Station on Craig Street was also invaded, and in a few moments the men's bedroom was under water and everything soaking. EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED DISTRICT. At 11 o'clock the water extended up St. Urbain Street, about fifty yards above Craig Street and from Craig up Alexander Street to Vitre, remaining the same; on Cote Street it was up to the Theatre Royal, and rose as high as the hubs of carriage wheels on Vitre, between St. George and Chenneville. On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George.  Some of these started out in a straight line, and continued so for a few hundred yards, when they suddenly stopped, and to find the continuation one had to look a quarter of a mile down stream. The dump seems to have grounded on the long wharf, and there it will probably stay. The whole population of the town seemed to have gathered in the central district to watch the progress of the flood, and many were speculating on the chances of a lengthened period of enforced idleness. All afternoon the water continued to rise, and by six o'clock Craig Street was impassable west from St. Urbain Street. The basements of the houses had long been flooded, but now the water rose over the side streets and the district between St. Denis and St. Lawrence Main was soon covered. Between Craig and Vitre, St. Constant and German Streets were perhaps the worst, and from the houses planks had been laid to the floating sidewalks. St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St.  Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street.  A room was impassable to foot passengers, and sundry express wagons, owned by enterprising drivers, ferried people across at the moderate sum of five cents per head. From halfway between Craig and Vitre, on Bleury Street, wagons were employed in transporting passengers to the higher ground on St. Peter, while a number of people were floating on improvised rafts, made from portions of sidewalks, on all the streets east from Victoria Square to Cote. At the corner of the latter and Craig incidents were numerous, some of which resulted in many people getting wet. Several photographers were observed taking views of the flooded streets. At night numerous boats flitted along St. Antoine, Bonaventure, McGill and other streets. AT POINT ST. CHARLES the suffering must be most severe. The water has risen to a height fully two feet higher than during the inundation last May. The wind is strong. At the Grand Trunk office the water came up to the desk at the innermost end. The works are, of course, stopped, only by last accounts communication is kept up.  The neighborhood of the Exchange Hotel and Horse Exchange was dry, and the numerous valuable horses in the custody of Mr. Kimball were all in excellent condition. The Grand Trunk workshops were closed, the furnace rooms being covered with water, though the yard was almost dry. ALONG CRAIG STREET, At 8 p.m., the water touched the highest mark, which was about eight inches below last year's flood. Craig Street was flooded from Victoria Square to the rising ground on St. Antoine Street, St. James from opposite Notre Dame from a mile down to Mr. Brouillette's store, a considerable distance past Chaboillez Square, and the intersecting streets were covered to a depth of several feet. The water had also risen on Craig Street at the corner of St. George, Bleury, Alexander and Hermine Streets. The water then began to subside, and by midnight had fallen nearly two inches. The cellars along Craig Street are filled. In the afternoon the engine room of Mr. Chanteloup's factory was invaded, and a little later the Gazette's office underwent a similar experience, necessitating a stoppage of work. The Herald also suffered in the same way.""",Craig and Vitre Streets,5,5,3,short-term absorptive capacity,"water, transportation",local,"""The flood had a significant impact on the infrastructure between Craig and Vitre Streets, with water levels rising to extreme heights, causing the Central Fire Station and numerous houses to be submerged.

"""How did the flooding specifically impact the Central Fire Station on Craig Street according to the passage?""","""Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street. It is impossible at the present time to form any estimate of the damage that has been done on the flooded streets. It would be easier to say who had not than who had suffered. Coming higher than was anticipated, higher than was ever before known, the water reached many houses and business places that made no preparation for such an event, and it was in these that the greatest damage occurred. THE SCENES ON SUNDAY. About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city. The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat.  St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St. Urbain and Cote Streets were also submerged, and boats and rafts were plying here and there.

The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat. The water extended along to Victoria Square and up to Jurors Street, and even those driving in cabs did not escape without wet feet, for the carriages were nearly up in the shafts. On Honavenltir Street, a little west of Victoria Square, the water suddenly made its appearance and spread along as far as the eye could reach. The street was also submerged from HUGH beyond the American building to some distance past Craig Street. St. Antoine Street was in a similar condition, which was flooded up to St. Maurice Street and the gallery of the Albion Hall was crowded all day by visitors, waiting on the busy street. There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous.  The stores were all closed, and those proprietors who had been fortunate enough to secure their sidewalks had manufactured them into floating pontoons. The floor of No. 4 fire station was quite under water. The scene was an animated one, with boats and canoes carrying people from their residences to terra firma, and express wagons carrying whole families. The water was all around. THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY STATION, but these standing high were at 4 o'clock quite dry. The track at the Lachine depot was quite under water, and it was learned that the cars had been removed and that trains would start from Fulford Street. In St. James Street, the water had penetrated and was pouring down Little St. Antoine and Little Craig Street, into Craig Street proper. At the Chaboillez Street police station were a number of boats, and the police, under the superintendence of Sergeants Kehoe, Carboneau, and Beattie were doing their best to render assistance to the imprisoned families. Rowing along Notre Dame Street the reporter's boat met with its first accident by running into a horse and nearly knocking it over, and many were the oaths vented on the heads of the oarsmen.

In it was a weasel, worthless to the trapper. Not far below the tree line, this is almost barren terrain where trees can take 100 years to grow just five metres. The high ground is rocky. Only down by the lakes and rivers where the traps are set is there anything resembling a forest. Great Whale Cree chief Robbie Dick says the nature of the land means the flooding will seriously reduce the amount of land where the region's animals can roam and feed. The flooding will cover caribou summer calving grounds, with unknown effects. He concedes that the area to be flooded is not huge compared with the La Grande project, the first phase of James Bay development, which will have swamped 15,000 square kilometres when it is finished in 1996.

Under the 1975 James Bay agreement, Environment Minister Pierre Paradis must forward the report on the $600-million infrastructure to two committees for study. One committee, set up to review projects that will have impact below the 55th parallel, has two members appointed by the Cree and three by the Quebec government. The other, for projects that have impact above the 55th parallel, has nine members: five appointed by the government and four by the Inuit. Both committees are involved because the effects of Great Whale will be felt on both sides of the 55th parallel.

In cases of light freight where it was inconvenient to have it removed, the goods were piled up on scaffolding out of reach of any possible flood that may come. The fact that the water began to fall after 7 o'clock did not seem to reassure everybody among the many who had opinions to offer regarding the possibilities of a flood.  The body was taken to the Church of St. James the Apostle, where an impressive service was held, Canon Ellegood and the assistant rector officiating. At its conclusion, the cortege reformed and proceeded up Bishop street, where many took sleighs and accompanied the remains to their last resting place at Mount Royal Cemetery. Among those who were present were Thomas Davidson, W. Wainwright, of the Grand Trunk Railway, who called upon Mr. Tarte and informally talked over with him the proposed Toronto-Collingwood line. It is too early yet to discuss definite proposals, but the prospect is that the scheme will rapidly assume practical form. Instead of diverging to Allendale, as is now done, the new road would have to be built as a straight line between Toronto and Collingwood. The idea of the Grand Trunk is that the traffic, upon reaching Toronto, might be divided, a portion being there transferred to vessels for transportation to Montreal, and a portion being taken direct by the main line of railway to that city. No doubt a question of subsidy would have to be considered if the construction of a new line were to be undertaken.  He did not seem to consider the valuable life of the reporter inside at all. However, there was nothing to do but to take a boat, and embarking on the turbid water the police station was reached in Grand Trunk Street. Here were stationed four boats, which were rendering good service, under the superintendence of """"Adjutant"""" Bilke and Sgt. Cambridge, in ferrying the inundated people from one place to another. Centre, Magdalen, Boucherville and Congregation Streets were all under water, and though numerous families residing on ground floors were rendered homeless, their more fortunate neighbors upstairs kindly accommodated them, and all seemed to be sinking the best of a bad situation. Expecting the flood, nearly all the small shopkeepers had removed their perishable goods to a place of safety. They then closed their stores, and were waiting patiently for the river to resume its normal condition.""",Grand Trunk Office Area,5,5,2,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, food",local,"""The flood has severely impacted the transportation infrastructure, halting operations at the Grand Trunk office and submerging trains and cars.

"""How has the flooding specifically impacted the infrastructure and political actions in St. Louis, as described in the passage?""","""The government has announced with precision the number of hectares of farmland inundated (21.5 million), the number of houses destroyed (5.58 million), and the number of sandbags (2 million) and wooden piles (7,800) being deployed to protect dikes in one particular county in Inner Mongolia, also affected by flooding. The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Friday that floodwaters were threatening China's largest oil field and described how Heilongjiang, an industrial and agricultural province that borders Russia, mobilized one million civilians and soldiers for a ""round-the-clock fight"" against the flooded Nen and Songhua rivers. More than 200,000 people were reportedly fighting flooding in Daqing, where the oil field is located. About 20,000 people were evacuated from the breach in the dike, which expanded to 1,650 feet at one point, Xinhua said. But when it comes to human losses, details suddenly become elusive. Officially, the nationwide casualty toll in flooding stands at a vague ""more than"" 2,000 people. In the latest flooding near the oil field, miraculously, there were no casualties, even after a second dike broke yesterday, according to government media.  In the budget brought down Tuesday, Finance Minister Michael Wilson promised legislation to give the federal government power to withhold other money if provinces don't meet the medicare standards of the health act. Ottawa will transfer an estimated $24 billion in cash to provinces this year, about a quarter of it specifically for health care and $12.4 billion in taxing powers. But critics ranging from the Canadian Medical Association to the National Council of Welfare say Ottawa won't be able to set national health-care standards if cash payments end. Clearly with no money going to the provinces we lose our power to Blinding snowstorm causes 100-car pileup near Vancouver CANADIAN PRESS VANCOUVER A blinding snowstorm caused a chain-reaction smashup involving 100 cars, trucks and semi-trailer units yesterday on the Trans-Canada Highway east of Vancouver. An RCMP freeway patrol spokesman said there were no serious injuries. One motorist was trapped under a car but his injuries were described as not being life-threatening. RCMP originally estimated the number of vehicles involved at 150. Blowing snow and whiteout conditions hampered police efforts at the Judge queries CANADIAN PRESS FORT MACLEOD, Alta.  Now, more than 7 million people live directly along the Mississippi, including more than 2 million around its confluence with the Missouri in St. Louis. """"No one is going to move St. Louis just because it happens to be in the river,"""" said David Johnson, an aquatic ecologist who is assistant director of the School of Natural Resources at Ohio State University. """"It's a question of working with the river or fighting the river. Fighting the river is almost always going to be a losing battle."""" He argues for restoring the kind of wide open spaces that the river once had before Europeans and the great cities came, wetlands where the water could collect in times of severe rains. The Army Corps of Engineers already has built some reservoirs to catch the runoff, although the current flooding suggests they might not be enough. In defense of the complex and normally efficient flood-control system, hydraulic engineers say that without the man-made reservoirs, the bloated river would now stretch from bluff to bluff, five miles across in spots, covering what we now know as Dubuque, Iowa, or St. Louis.  Put in that narrow way, I'd say yes it was the wrong policy for that time because it did stimulate the economy, he said in a post-budget interview with Southam News. Tax reform was quite a powerful influence. It is the first time Wilson has publicly admitted the timing of his tax reforms added to inflation, interest rates and the deficit. The opposition has always claimed the timing of the income-tax and sales-tax reforms were political. The good news part of the tax reforms, the reduction in income taxes, was implemented just prior to the 1988 election while the bad news, the goods-and-services tax, was delayed until after the election. But Wilson said in the interview that the timing of the income-tax reforms was forced on him by reforms that were taking place in the U. W. de Klerk to repeal his country's race-segregation laws. Clark, who was chairman of the meeting, said the sanctions imposed in the mid-1980s will be lifted only when there are concrete actions, not promises. An External Affairs official said the government stands by its policy and noted that despite the increase in 1990 exports, trade with South Meddling in medicare?  Example: the mandate and responsibility of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission to oversee and approve the licensing and operation of nuclear reactors at Chalk River. That commission has deemed the Chalk River facilities to be dangerous and the last thing the nuclear industry needs is a nuclear accident. For political leaders to overrule their own safety commission and behave like the mayor of a city overruling a traffic ticket properly issued by its police department (a trivial analogy by comparison) is so wrong. And then to ask the president of that commission to explain her and her commission's actions (under the veiled threat of dismissal), while ignoring the fact unqualified politicians have placed expediency above safety, is so wrong. Alex Brown Pierrefonds It's our money Re: Harper government takes wrong turn on tax policy (Gazette, Jan 4), I have a bit of a problem with Peter Hadekel's claim the reduction in the federal GST is an awful waste of $12 billion, which is the estimated annual cost to the federal treasury.

Joe Vincent, the well-known boatman, was on hand and was ready to place himself at the disposal of Aid. Stevenson. That gentleman arrived in the Central Station, accompanied by Captain Beckingham, of the salvage corps, who, acting on instructions, had roused the colonel from his sleep and brought him down. The theory was that the deep navigation cutting was the cause of the jam, and that it was loaded about Thibaudeau at Longue Pointe. Col. Stevenson proceeded to investigate, and as a result came to the conclusion that any attempt, such as suggested, would be fruitless. In the first place, Vincent gave it as his opinion that the placing of dynamite would be a most dangerous work, and that after it was placed it was ten to one that it would not do any good. The scheme was dropped as of no use, and the chairman of the inundation committee got home again. NOW THE RIVER.  All trains have been shipped and washouts have occurred in several places. An unbroken is reported on the track at St. Louis, which village, or the greater part of it, is covered with water. The suburbs have suffered severely. The Gazette's press, engine and electric light rooms are five feet deep. The basement is affected in a minor degree. The Withee establishment on Bonaventure Street is surrounded by water and the cellar as well as those of other buildings in that vicinity flooded. The police station on St. Nicholas Street is in a like fix. All will, it is understood, be more or less dependent on their more fortunate rivals for assistance in making their regular appearance today.

Nolan stirred up a little storm by asking why St. Ann's ward was not represented on the inundation committee. Aid. Wilson and Germain moved that the names of Aid. Nolan and Stevenson be added, and this caused more trouble. Aid. Nolan having complained of being struck off the committee, Aid. Conroy asked what right Aid. Nolan had to demand to be on the committee. Aid. Nolan replied somewhat warmly to the effect that St. Ann's ward had suffered most from floods, it was most interested in flood prevention, and should not be ignored. Aid. Conroy said he had given way to Aid. Cunningham, who had more property in St. Ann's ward than any of its representatives. Aid. Nolan: By what right does Aid.  The area of high water has extended downwards and the village at Longue Pointe is partially inundated. The work of relieving the wants of the inundated sufferers has been well carried out, and very few deserving cases are believed to have been overlooked. The misery is thus reduced to the smallest possible extent, but is still very great, and must have been increased by the rain of Saturday and the fall in temperature last night.

Many of the principal buildings were lighted by lamps or candles. Dr. Thayer called on the Mayor last night and informed him that the water had backed up until it was flush with the head of the Lachine Rapids, and that there was great danger of its bursting over the banks and sweeping down over the flats. He urged His Worship to have the jam at Longueuil blown up with dynamite. The Mayor, who was very sick, gave his authorization to anything that could be done, and referred Dr. Thayer to Aid.

There is a washout on the Northern and Northwestern between this city and the beach.  After last summer's Oka crisis, this vision is enough to make politicians shudder. But as Hydro pushes ahead determined to meet its 1998 deadline for completing the power project and enjoying the Quebec government's blessing, natives in Great Whale, the community most affected by the project, are starting to talk about a showdown. """"Oh yes, we'll be right in the middle,"""" Weetaltuk said this week when asked if she would take part in a blockade natives are considering. James Masty checks a marten trap near Great Whale. To stop the planned road, Great Whale's approximately 500 Inuit and 500 Cree have opposed James Bay II through publicity campaigns in southern Quebec and the United States and through court challenges. But their frustration is growing. Quebec has decided that Hydro should split the environmental review of the Great Whale project so it can start building $600 million in roads and infrastructure before the actual dams and power stations are approved. With Hydro planning to hand the Quebec government its impact study on infrastructure next week, road construction could be under way in three months.

CARTWINSUR, Ont, April 6 A heavy gale struck this village about noon and carried away the south end of the building formerly known as the Royal Exchange hotel, owned by James Flake, of Toronto, and smashed in the front window of a tailor shop. Toronto, April 6 A heavy gale has been blowing here since early this morning, accompanied by snow. It is feared that considerable damage has been done to the island and breakwater. About nine o'clock the scaffolding was blown from Manning's arcade, King Street, and struck John Green, coal carter, who was driving past at the time, on the head, knocking him off in front of the wheels. The cart passed over his right leg and abdomen, breaking his leg and inflicting internal injuries that may prove fatal.

For example, Meek said, """"suppose you are sitting at a red light, waiting for it to turn green,"""" adding: """"At a certain point, based on past experience, you will begin to put your foot on the gas in anticipation that the light is about to turn. Unconsciously, you are counting the seconds, without looking at your watch. But if the light fails to turn green in the expected amount of time, you start fretting, wondering if it is working properly. If enough time passes, you may decide to run the red light.""""

Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile. Suburban traffic was blocked for several hours in the morning and after that trains ran at long intervals. All trains were delayed. Some that were due in the early morning hours had not been heard from at night. The superintendent of mails in the general Post Office reported that the mail train from Boston, due at 6 a.m., had not been heard from, nor had the mails been received up to 10 o'clock tonight. The incoming mails from other parts, he said, were from two hours to an unknown number of hours behind time. The damage to small shipping in the harbor and down the bay was very great. It is reported tonight that several tug boats belonging to the Kingston Towing Company, together with a large number of canal boats, were sunk up the river by the force of the gale. The shores of the Hudson are littered with wreckage. At 9 o'clock this morning a fleet of twenty-two ocean-going steamships were anchored in the bay.  But their frustration is growing.

This province's most costly winter storm was a raging blizzard that dumped 41.2 centimetres of snow on Montreal the night before the St. Patrick's Day parade in March 1993. Unlike this week's ice storm, the 1993 blizzard - which ran up an insurance bill of $18 million in Quebec, Eastern Ontario and Nova Scotia - seemed to end as soon as it came and the parade went ahead as scheduled the following day. Medza said the worst damage being caused this week is by tree branches falling on cars and homes.  Brig.-Gen. Christian Couture, who commands about 4,700 of the 9,000 soldiers deployed across southern Quebec in the aftermath of last week's ice storm, noted yesterday that the Surete is in charge of the overall coordination of policing efforts. ""There may be some (jealousy and power-jostling between the army and Surete), but I have not experienced any of it,"" Couture said as he surveyed operations in Boucherville. Whether working with provincial or municipal police officers or members of their own unit, his men ""feel privileged and have a sense of accomplishment in assisting their fellow citizens,"" Couture said. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Carignan, a commandeered school bus full of soldiers lumbered around sinkholes in the thick ice that has consumed Lareau Rd. At various points, pairs of soldiers disembarked, boots with thick treads on their feet and smiles on their faces. ""Our orders are to go door-to-door on the left side of this street and determine if the residents are adequately protected from the cold,"" Master Cpl. Stephane Jodoin explained. The soldiers were on the lookout for homeowners using dangerous fuels like kerosene to heat their homes.  The first big snowstorm of that season dumped 20 centimetres on the city - on March 14. ""That was also the season with the least snow on record,"" Lam noted. Only 93.1 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal that year, down from an average of 228.4 centimetres.

At West Wemyss, on the Firth of Forth, north of Edinburgh, seven foreign colliers broke their moorings and all were wrecked. The torrential rains are interfering greatly with traffic on all the northern railways. A Norwegian vessel was wrecked on Salts Rock, near Leith, and thirteen were drowned.  South, the storm has ravaged beaches and coastal highways, and has left more than a million people without power. The heaviest damage from the storm occurred along a stretch of the Florida Panhandle, from Pensacola east to Panama City. Roofs were torn off houses and boats were tossed up on highways where the storm surge - high water driven ashore by strong winds - left roadways buried beneath tonnes of sand. Early estimates put insurance-covered damage alone at $1.8 billion in Florida, and at another $1 billion in Alabama and Georgia. The damage estimates made Hurricane Opal the third most costly storm in terms of insurance losses after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, insurance officials said. Opal weakened to a tropical depression by late morning, moving north after its Wednesday night landfall, down from peak sustained winds of more than 240 km/h. It headed for the Great Lakes.
