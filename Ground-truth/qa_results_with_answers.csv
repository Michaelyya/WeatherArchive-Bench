"How has the recent heavy rainstorm affected the logging and river navigation infrastructure in the Chippewa Valley, and what are the anticipated changes in operations as a result?","THE LM CROP, Eau Claire, Wis, March 30 A heavy rainstorm, which set in early Saturday morning, followed by moderate weather, has virtually suspended logging operations in the Chippewa Valley, and the camps, with few exceptions, have broken up, after having accomplished a good season's work. The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river. The rivers are all open now, but the dams are frozen to such an extent that logs cannot be run through. On the Wolf, Little Wolf and Waupaca rivers are large crops of logs, and the present season will be a good one for rivermen. The Wisconsin Central Railway is running extra log trains daily, and there is said to be logs enough on their line north of Stevens Point to furnish business for the road all summer. The Weed & Gumaer Manufacturing Company of Weyauwega buys logs from one hundred miles north, saws them at their mills at that place, and re-ships the dressed lumber back to Stevens Point, forty miles north of Weyauwega. There are several new sawmills being erected at the small towns on the railroad, and a lively business will be carried on this summer.","{
