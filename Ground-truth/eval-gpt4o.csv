"How has the recent heavy rainstorm affected the logging and river navigation infrastructure in the Chippewa Valley, and what are the anticipated changes in operations as a result?","THE LM CROP, Eau Claire, Wis, March 30 A heavy rainstorm, which set in early Saturday morning, followed by moderate weather, has virtually suspended logging operations in the Chippewa Valley, and the camps, with few exceptions, have broken up, after having accomplished a good season's work. The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river. The rivers are all open now, but the dams are frozen to such an extent that logs cannot be run through. On the Wolf, Little Wolf and Waupaca rivers are large crops of logs, and the present season will be a good one for rivermen. The Wisconsin Central Railway is running extra log trains daily, and there is said to be logs enough on their line north of Stevens Point to furnish business for the road all summer. The Weed & Gumaer Manufacturing Company of Weyauwega buys logs from one hundred miles north, saws them at their mills at that place, and re-ships the dressed lumber back to Stevens Point, forty miles north of Weyauwega. There are several new sawmills being erected at the small towns on the railroad, and a lively business will be carried on this summer.","Chippewa Valley, Wisconsin",3,4,3,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, water",regional,"The recent heavy rainstorm in the Chippewa Valley has caused a significant rise in river levels, temporarily suspending logging operations and affecting river navigation infrastructure.

What human health impact is mentioned in the passage as a result of the storm's violence?,"A few minutes after 1 o'clock the storm-signal was up at the Citadel station, and people then began to prepare for a storm. Many still stuck to the belief that it would be only an ordinary March blow, but the majority began to doubt this, and made preparations for what they expected would soon turn out to be a fulfillment of Wiggins' warning. Steamers and sailing vessels in the docks were secured to their wharves with extra hawsers, and merchandise in places of insecurity was removed to higher and safer quarters. No remarkable change occurred throughout the following two hours, but about 4 o'clock the wind quickened, gaining strength, light short distance when the storm was at its height, between 8 and 9, but pulled up before getting into danger. The steamer Sarmatian, from Liverpool, and steamer Newfoundland, from St. John's, Nfld., which arrived this morning, report having felt the blow only lightly, and were caused no anxiety.

"What specific damage did the storm cause to the infrastructure at the south end of the city in Nova Scotia, and how did this affect the Howell tin-dry?","The high tide has gone completely down and the vessels ride easily in their docks. The steamer Sardinian, for Liverpool with the weekly mail, still remains in port. The effects of last evening's storm, reports of the violence of which are now coming in from all parts of Nova Scotia, prove it to have been not so serious as was expected. At the south end of the city part of an old wharf on which the Howell tin-dry was situated was blown away, but the other wharves and property on the water line suffered only slightly. The damage to vessels in the harbor was quite bad, and the heaving up of a few planks in wharves makes up all the other damage yet reported. Vessels at anchor in the harbor rode out the gale without injury. The barometer fell to the highest point known here since the Saxby gale. At eight o'clock it was nearly on a level with the wharves and at nine, when at its highest, the sea washed over in many places, and barrels of flour, meal and other merchandise in exposed places were swept about, but no serious damage, it is thought, has resulted.","South end of the city, Nova Scotia",3,2,3,short-term absorptive capacity,"transportation, information",local,"The storm caused part of an old wharf at the south end of the city, where the Howell tin-dry was located, to be blown away.

"What specific reason does the City Surveyor give for not entertaining claims for flooding related to the Coteau Harron main sewer during heavy rainstorms, and how does this relate to the historical context of when the sewer was originally constructed?","ML COST $400,080 Several New Intercepting Sewers Proposed by Mr St George THE FLOODING OF CELLARS In Great Part Caused by Outside Municipalities-The City Surveyor had Reported This but no Action was Taken by the Council The City Surveyor has addressed the following important communication to the chairman and members of the Road committee on the flooding of cellars, and also on the necessity of constructing a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke and St James streets. It reads as follows: Gentlemen, I beg to attach you herewith a report of Mr Brittain, recommending the construction of a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke street from Beaudry street to Coteau Neiges road. The construction of this sewer has become necessary by the fact that the city is receiving so many claims for flooding through the overflowing of the Coteau Harron main sewer and the intercepting sewer during very heavy exceptional rain storms. In my opinion these claims should not be entertained for the following reasons: 1. The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then.","Coteau Harron, [City not specified, inferred from context]",3,4,2,medium-term adaptive capacity,water,community,"The City Surveyor does not entertain claims for flooding related to the Coteau Harron main sewer during heavy rainstorms because the sewer was originally constructed in 1867 in a low swampy valley, where no houses existed at the time. This historical context implies that the current flooding issues are partly due to urban development in areas not initially designed to handle such infrastructure demands."
"What political responsibility does the city attribute to Westmount municipality regarding the flooding issues associated with the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street, according to the passage?","The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then. The natural conclusion is that the houses must have been built since the sewer was constructed, and therefore, the city should not be held responsible. In regard to the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street, there is only one portion of it which is at present needed during heavy rainstorms, that is between St Lawrence and St George streets. These floodings take place only when there is an exceptionally heavy rainstorm, but these floodings would not have occurred if Westmount municipality, who had the permission of the city to drain their drainage into the intercepting sewer, had abided by the plan which they submitted to the city.","Westmount, Montreal",3,4,3,short-term absorptive capacity,water,local,The city attributes political responsibility to the Westmount municipality for the flooding issues associated with the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street. The flooding occurs during exceptionally heavy rainstorms and would not have happened if Westmount had adhered to the drainage plan they submitted to the city.
"What specific action has been proposed to temporarily relieve the flooding on St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, and how does the passage suggest holding the municipalities of Lachine and St Henri accountable for the damages caused to Montreal properties?","I have repeatedly notified the city of their action and have asked the city to allow me to dam the end of our sewer so as to prevent the water coming from Lachine and St Henri doing damage to the properties of the citizens of Montreal, but so far I have received no instructions to do so, and in consequence, the cellars of the properties on that street, and also on the adjoining streets, are nearly always flooded in heavy rain storms; therefore, it is necessary to build this sewer, and the cost of same should be charged to these two municipalities, and I would advise the city to notify them notarially of it. You will note by the agreement between the city and these municipalities that they rendered themselves liable for all damages which they might cause to the city. 3. In order to relieve St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, on the old Coteau Harron main sewer, we can make a temporary relief for these floodings by constructing a sewer on St Catherine street between De Lorimier avenue and Papineau road this autumn.",Montreal,4,4,3,short-term absorptive capacity,water,local,"A temporary relief for the flooding on St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, has been proposed by constructing a sewer between De Lorimier avenue and Papineau road this autumn.

What political impact might the delay in the Finance committee's response to the recommendation for the de Levis street intercepting sewer have on the city's infrastructure planning as outlined in Perival W St George's report?,"I would also remind you that a year ago I recommended an intercepting sewer on de Levis street to drain the northeast part of the city; this report has gone before the Finance committee, but we have heard nothing further. It is necessary that this sewer should be constructed in conjunction with the other sewers, which is included in the estimate made by Mr Brittain herewith attached. In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that the Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost. Yours truly, (Signed) Perival W St George, City Surveyor.",Northeast part of the city,3,4,2,medium-term adaptive capacity,"water, transportation",community,"The delay in the Finance committee's response to the recommendation for the de Levis street intercepting sewer could significantly impact the city's infrastructure planning.

This could hinder medium-term adaptive capacity in managing water and transportation systems in the community."

New York, November 27. When the people of New York awoke this morning they found the blizzard that raged when they retired was still in progress. The storm, which had begun with the soft, sleety snow on Saturday, at noon had increased greatly, and with the heavier snowfall, the wind was blowing a gale at midnight. There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly.",New York,4,3,3,short-term absorptive capacity,transportation,regional,"The blizzard significantly impacted railway operations in New York, as evidenced by the blockades caused by heavy snowfall and high winds. Historically, the severity of this storm is compared to a similar event ten years prior, and even further back to a storm in Boston in 1881, highlighting its exceptional nature."
How did the snowfall and drifting during the blizzard affect the trenches dug by the street railroads for transforming the motive power from cable to electricity?,"There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly. It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity.","[City inferred from context, likely New York City]",4,3,3,short-term absorptive capacity,transportation,local,"The blizzard caused significant snowfall and drifting, with snow accumulating nearly a foot and drifting up to four or five feet in places.

How did the heavy snow and sleet specifically impact the operation of the underground trolley lines compared to the cable roads in the city?,"In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable.

An order was sent out from police headquarters to the various precinct commanders to have arrested all persons found alone in a condition that would raise even the suspicion of intoxication. As a result, the police courts today were crowded with eminently respectable looking persons who were let go with a small fine and an admonition to get in out of the snow.

A record-breaking November blizzard swept over the greater portion of New England last night and today, completely demoralizing traffic of every description and well nigh paralysing telegraphic and telephonic communication, while the northeast gale, coming on a high course of tides, drove the sea far beyond its usual limits and made a mark along shore only exceeded by the memorable hurricane of 1801. The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly.

Large crowds of people collected in the affected districts and stood in groups watching the water as it slowly crept up, bearing with it blocks of ice, which stranded on the street as it would ebb for a short time, only to return with greater volume within a comparatively short period. The chief cause of the flood was doubtless the breaking-up of the ice in the reaches above the Lachine Rapids. At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move.

About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city.

Accidents were numerous in the flooded streets and furnished a source of innocent merriment to onlookers. The district between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, which lies lower than the eastern part of the business section, suffered more, and in some places the water rose to St. Sacrament Street where two merchants were driving brisk trade, conveying merchants and their employees to and from the different stores at exorbitant prices. Quite a number of men were seen with rubber boots up to their thighs trudging through the water, rather than pay fifty cents for a seat of 200 or 300 feet.

Joe Leof's being flooded out, most of his customers could be seen sitting on the doorstep looking disconsolately at the waste of waters, flowing eastwards towards Jarry Park where the bank rises. The water did not extend so far, and people were able to go down as far as Commissioners Street. The ice was not broken up nearly so much as jammed, and presented the appearance of a solid sheet, slightly roughened on top, the only evidences of shifts having taken place being the encumbrance of ice along the revetment wall and the cronkedness of the river roads.

All afternoon the water continued to rise, and by six o'clock Craig Street was impassable west from St. Urbain Street. The basements of the houses had long been flooded, but now the water rose over the side streets and the district between St. Denis and St. Lawrence Main was soon covered.
