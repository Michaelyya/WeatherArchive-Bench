Violent gales prevailed along the Spanish coasts last evening, and many wrecks, chiefly of small craft, are reported. The gale is subsiding in the North Sea today, but tugs and trawlers continue to bring to Lowestoft and Yarmouth the crews of foundered fishing vessels, several of which are still unaccounted for. The gale did not reach Scotland, but heavy rainfalls prevailed throughout that section.

In Western Ontario TORONTO, Ont, May 21 The rainstorm which began here on Thursday last shows tonight no sign of abating. It has already surpassed anything known in the city during the fifty years in which the observatory has kept a record. The nearest approach was in 1868 when 4 inches of rain fell between May 13 and May 15. In this case nearly seven inches have fallen in the continuous rain since Thursday. There is no serious damage so far reported, though cellars are flooded here and there. The Don River has risen greatly and the supports of the Winchester Street wooden bridge have been weakened. There is some fear it may be carried away. The ferry service to the island has been almost abandoned. The Chicora did not venture to Niagara today owing to the heavy sea. Roadways have been injured more or less by the heavy rainfall in different parts of the city. Telegrams from towns west of here state that a good deal of damage has been done to crops and small fruits.","The sea is running heavy and no bodies have been recovered. The two men saved from the dredge were terribly exhausted. The property was owned by J. K. F. Baldwin, of Rochester, and valued at $20,000. It is nearly a total loss.

"How did the reports of severe gales and a tidal wave on the coast of Nova Scotia and the eastern United States impact the stock value of Wiggins, and what was the subsequent trend in its value by the evening?","Special telegrams to Bradt & Frt from points at which industrial disturbances have been noticeable indicate that there are only 45,000 men on strike or locked out this week, against 44,000 one year ago, which will cover the number of granite cutters and handlers striking or locked out in New England and elsewhere. Of rumors of 76,000 men on strike or locked out published of late, total bank clearings this week, as wired from 68 cities exclusively to Bradt & Frt, amount to $1,234,114,000, apparently 8 percent in excess of the week's total a year ago, and nominally about the same as last week. Exports of wheat (and flour as such) from both coasts of the United States this week, as telegraphed to Bradt & Frt, amounted to 1,000,000 bushels, contrasted with 3,621,000 bushels last week, and with 2,600,000 in the third week of May, 1891.

Robinson, Postal. A snow blockade was produced on the 2nd inst. on the Sorel and Yamaska section of the Southeastern Railway. It still continues and is likely to do so. The difficulty is that there is not any snowplough on this section and that one cannot be got there owing to the railway bridge over the Yamaska, which broke down about a year ago not having yet been rebuilt. As the ordinary road between these two points has been almost impassable from snowdrifts, mail communication has been suspended.","The Grand Trunk trains were not much delayed, except that from Portland, which was reported twelve hours late.

"What specific damage did the storm cause to the infrastructure at the south end of the city in Nova Scotia, and how did this affect the Howell tin-dry?","The wind was then blowing at the rate of thirty-seven miles an hour and apparently gaining in velocity. About nine, however, it calmed suddenly down and the property owners and people began to be more confident, but the breeze again sprung up from a more easterly direction, though not with as great strength as before. The tide is now falling and no more heavy weather is expected tonight, but in the morning, it is said by old fishermen and observers of the weather, with the incoming tide the wind will rise again and blow with equal if not greater violence.

What political impact might the delay in the Finance committee's response to the recommendation for the de Levis street intercepting sewer have on the city's infrastructure planning as outlined in Perival W St George's report?,"A BATCH OF TRUE BILLS Returned by the Grand Jury in the Court of Queen's Bench Yesterday. The Court of Queen's Bench resumed its sitting for the June term yesterday, the Hon. Justice Church presiding. Messrs. A. Gobeil, of the Public Works department, Ottawa, asking that the city's share of the cost of the Flood Commission should now be paid, its report having been presented. What that share amounted to was not stated, but some of the members thought that $5,000 should be sufficient, and it was agreed to pay that amount. A letter from the Abattoir Company, in relation to reduction in their water rates, was laid over for future consideration, Mr. Bayard, manager of the Abattoir Company, appearing before the committee in support of the proposition. A report from the Roads Committee, recommending the granting of Dupuls Freres' application for a chain stone in front of their premises, St. Catherine street east, was concurred in, as were other reports from the same committee with regard to the construction of a sewer on Upper Stanley street, another on Torrance street and another on Bishop street.","I have repeatedly notified the city of their action and have asked the city to allow me to dam the end of our sewer so as to prevent the water coming from Lachine and St Henri doing damage to the properties of the citizens of Montreal, but so far I have received no instructions to do so, and in consequence, the cellars of the properties on that street, and also on the adjoining streets, are nearly always flooded in heavy rain storms; therefore, it is necessary to build this sewer, and the cost of same should be charged to these two municipalities, and I would advise the city to notify them notarially of it.

Mrs. Baird offered to give the committee the necessary land to make a connection between Simpson street and Pine avenue, making an entrance to the park, if the city would give her an equal amount of land from the park. The city agreed to recommend the acceptance of the offer, and it was sent to the Park Commissioners. The report of the expert appointed to look into the claim of Mr. Barnard for damages caused by the opening of Church street reported that that gentleman's property had, in his opinion, not been damaged, but improved by $765. It was agreed to open Overdale avenue to the projected line of Mackay street if the proprietors would cede the land. The Chairman, Aid. Wilson and Aid. LaLuc were re-appointed as the representatives of the Road committee on the Improvement committee.

He had had, he said, an interview with the street railway authorities before going to Quebec, and had called a meeting of his committee in consequence, to see if they could not come to a satisfactory arrangement. The difficulty arose by the Health Committee and the Provincial Board of Health asking them to stop dumping snow on vacant property, including Fletcher's field, as it was injurious to health. Mr. Cunningham had written, on behalf of the Street Railway Company, stating that the continuance of the removal of snow by the company had been rendered impossible by the action of the Health Committee, and unless something was done they would have to ask the city to remove it from the tracks to the curb.

What specific impacts did the storm have on infrastructure in the principal street and how did these impacts potentially affect human health in the area?,"Lefebvre, a toxicologist who acted as a resource person at the environmental hearings, says his department will now look at whether it's feasible to isolate various factors that affect the health of the east-end population. He must ascertain whether the population is large enough to draw conclusions about the effects of atmospheric pollution, once people affected by other health issues, such as smoking, are discounted. CLSCs serving a few other sectors of the island show consistently higher rates of certain health problems than those in Montreal's east end.

Welfare recipients show higher incidence of asthma than wealthier people, for example, but it is not clear whether poorer neighborhoods generally have worse air quality.","We know that but we cannot say whether this is the effects of industry or because of other factors.

"What specific actions did Albert F. Kirkland take to address the human health impacts caused by the storm, and how did these actions relate to the immediate condition of his brother George?","His companion tried to draw him away, but evidently excited by the storm, McKenzie not only retained his hold of the first wire, but also caught up the other end. He was killed instantly, his frightfully disfigured body being subsequently disengaged by linemen summoned to the scene. The ambulance of the General Hospital was ordered, but the services of the doctor were of no avail. The body was subsequently taken to the morgue. The deceased was about 25 years of age, and was by trade a brass finisher, at which he worked in the city. Since May last he had been boarding at 30 St. Antoine Street. It was said that he came from Glengarry; but his people were not known. Friends of the deceased were endeavoring to locate his parents last night, to convey to them the sad news of his death. The danger from live wires after the passage of the storm was so great that Aid. Mullery, who passed along St. Antoine street after the accident, immediately telephoned for police protection, and a squad of men were afterwards detailed to warn citizens against danger. These men performed good service, and no doubt to this precaution was largely due the prevention of many other accidents of a serious nature.","We want them back and all that takes quite some capital and that's why we want to raise some private capital.

He confessed he originally proposed to become a doctor and got so far as to be allowed to play on the outskirts of St. Mary's Hospital, where he picked up a great deal of the half knowledge, so dangerous in medical matters. Continuing, he said that he had mixed with doctors the world over, and had seen them going to certain death with no hope of reward, because it was ""business.""

Provincial police reported 12 motorists were injured. Blowing snow reduced visibility to zero, causing cars to hit each other or slide off the road on both lanes of the highways, closing the roads. It was so sudden, Constable Francois Dore said of the storm as he surveyed the wreckage at the first pileup of 40 cars on Highway 25 near Mascouche.","The crowd retaliated by smashing every window in the next car that came along and badly injured one of the passengers by broken glass and slightly injured the only other occupant of the car. General hostilities ceased at dark tonight, though both sides kept up a desultory fire until a late hour. It will be a great snap for the lawyers, as the city proclaims its intention of bringing an action against the railway company, while the company intends suing the city for damages. Tonight the Mayor instructed the City Engineer to inform the railway company that unless sufficient teams and men are employed tomorrow to remove the snow from the streets altogether the city will do so at the company's expense.

Ottawa, June 14. The tail end of an uncanny looking electric storm passed over the city shortly after noon today, rain fell with great force, accompanied by fierce gusts of wind and thunder and lightning. One clap of thunder made everything in the city vibrate and rattle. Quite a number of awnings, signs, loose bricks, fences and trees were wrenched off or broken, or carried away by the wind. Shortly after noon today when the storm burst the loud thunder was almost instantly followed by a summons for the fire brigade. On arriving it was found that the thunderbolt had struck the chimney of the one and a half storey wooden house occupied by Mr. Powers and taking a downward course had carried away the gable end of the house. Fortunately the disaster was not accompanied by fire. The plaster inside was considerably broken and the damage amounts to $6,000.

Nolan stirred up a little storm by asking why St. Ann's ward was not represented on the inundation committee. Aid. Wilson and Germain moved that the names of Aid. Nolan and Stevenson be added, and this caused more trouble. Aid. Nolan having complained of being struck off the committee, Aid. Conroy asked what right Aid."
"What political controversy arose regarding the formation of the committee to address flood prevention in St. Ann's ward, as described in the passage?","I write this, not protesting against their using the same colors, but, knowing that they were unaware that another club already had them, and I have no doubt that as soon as they hear of it, they will make a change, not so much for the Holly club's sake, but in their own interests also. Holly, It Was Too Damp, The Montreal Snowshoe club had intended to have a tramp of some sort last night, but it was too bad even for snowshoers, and as the bugle band was not musically inclined, it was put off till next Wednesday. The Emeralds, The Emerald Snowshoe club held their committee meeting last night preparatory to their annual meeting which takes place next Monday. There is considerable talk as to the outcome of the voting on the presidency, as there are three candidates in the field. There are two amendments to the constitution which will have to be decided, and as the secretary's and treasurer's report, which is to be submitted, is a very favorable one the committee expects a large attendance of the members.

We have soft balmy weather, such as I have often seen in the Kootenays about the 1st of May. We have had only two or three frosty nights this winter. This is a most unsatisfactory climate for lazy church-goers. I do not remember more than two or three Sabbaths during the last twelve months which, as far as weather was concerned, could furnish anything like a decent excuse for stopping at home."" With Mr. McShane profession and practice are not always in consonance. It is evidently on the former that he bases his hopes for election in St. Ann's ward, else his absence for two days in succession from the Inundation committee would not have made it impossible for that body to perform the work entrusted to it by the City council. St. Ann's ward is interested above all others in the question of preventing periodical floods, and of all members of the council its representative should be the last to thus neglect his duty.","C, to the Presbyterian Record, the Rev.

Paris, September 27. Advices received here state that the steamer Magadena foundered during a gale off the coast of the department of Landes, in southwestern France. All the members of her crew were drowned. Paris, September 27. A severe gale prevailed yesterday along the French coast, and much damage was done. The storm was not only severe along the northern coast, but also along the shore of the Mediterranean. The mail steamer was delayed at Marseilles, and warships were compelled to put into port for shelter. Skibbereen, Ireland, September 27. A fishing boat belonging here was caught in the gale last night and wrecked; her crew of eight men were drowned. London, September 27. Violent gales prevailed along the Spanish coasts last evening, and many wrecks, chiefly of small craft, are reported. The gale is subsiding in the North Sea today, but tugs and trawlers continue to bring to Lowestoft and Yarmouth the crews of foundered fishing vessels, several of which are still unaccounted for.","Irvine News Also Their Own Life Part of the crew of the life-saving crew at Hythe, while engaged in the work of rescuing the shipwrecked crew of a French schooner, were swept from their boat and drowned. From Dungeness, too, comes a story of the loss of some of the brave and hardy lifeboatmen. A foreign barque went ashore at that place, and the lifeboat men started gallantly to the rescue of her crew. A tremendously heavy sea was running and the lifeboat broached to. Once in the trough of the sea she capsized and all hands went overboard. Five of the crew were swept away before they could grasp the lifelines on the sides of the boat, and though they wore cork jackets they were lost. The other men succeeded in righting their boat and scrambling in. Several vessels are ashore between Dover and Dungeness. A number of vessels have been driven past Sandgate with their ensigns hoisted with the jack down, showing that they were in distress and desired assistance.","A barge was capsized by the force of the wind in the Upper Elbe and six persons were drowned.

"What specific measures were taken to ensure the safety of the crew aboard the large steamer stranded at Merry Castle during the blinding storm, and how did these measures impact the crew's health and safety?","The Glasgow Citizen says that the Labrador had a summer-like passage most of the way over and made good running, but as she neared this side the captain and officer were unable to take sights for three days owing to the fog. Consequently, the only guide to the position of the ship was that given by dead reckoning, which, by reason of the currents, was untrustworthy. The captain had been on deck since 1 p.m. Tuesday when the ship struck. The second officer was on the sick list, and the third officer had taken the watch with the captain. The passengers, who were in their berths, were awakened by a crash and rushed on deck. The Labrador had run well up on a rock and was filling rapidly. The ship was rocking with the heavy swell, which made the launching of the boats difficult. The cooler-headed of the passengers calmed the women, and the crew did their duty with the most praiseworthy discipline. When the first boat was ready the women and children were lowered into it with ropes. While the other boats were being lifted the Viking hove in sight and took on board all of the passengers and crew, except those in one boat, which made its way to the Skerryvore lighthouse.","Consequently, the only guide to the position of the ship was that given by dead reckoning, which, by reason of the currents, was untrustworthy.

All of the passengers are in good spirits.","A large quantity of oil was noted, and had a wonderful effect in breaking the force of the waves. The passengers were kept below nearly the whole of the voyage, it being quite unsafe for them at any time to go on deck, and much delight was expressed when land was sighted. During the storm, one of the sailors, named Mitchell, fell heavily on the deck and sustained a broken leg. On arrival of the Corean at Grosse Isle, a child belonging to one of the steerage passengers, a Russian Jew, was found to be affected with chickenpox or smallpox, and was taken ashore to the Quarantine hospital. The steerage quarters were thoroughly disinfected, and all the passengers and crew had to submit to vaccination. Several of the crew who absolutely refused to allow the operation to be performed were removed, and will have to remain in quarantine for a period of fourteen days. The friends of the work will go in a body to St. Thomas' Church. The Hansa line steamship Kehrwieder, Captain Brackert, arrived in port yesterday, after a voyage of twenty-one days."
"What were the impacts of the snowstorm on transportation infrastructure and human health in Limerick, as described in the passage?","Two trains full of passengers in the Midlands were snowed up last night and the passengers were not rescued until this morning.

The governors of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey declared states of emergencies in coastal areas including New York City as winds gusting to hurricane force toppled power lines and ripped roofs off houses. The storm blew out skyscraper windows in New York City and closed the city's transit system. A metre of snow fell in Pennsylvania and five deaths were reported. The National Guard in Virginia was sent to evacuate up to 2,500 rural residents isolated by heavy snow since Thursday. National Guardsmen also were called out to help evacuate thousands from shore communities in Massachusetts and New Jersey. In Toronto, a city routinely paralyzed at the sight of the season's first snowflake, traffic was reduced to a crawl as plows worked to clear streets of almost knee-deep snow piled up in waist-high banks.

Flood at Sherbrooke. Sherbrooke, Que., April 17. The floods have increased here, the water having risen some 22 inches since 6 p.m. yesterday. There is over three feet of water on the floors of these factories situated on the flats. In some cases the flumes have floated off, thus entailing stoppage of other works, which, in themselves, are free of water. The replacing of the flumes is a difficult and slow operation. Numerous workmen have before them an unpleasant prospect of many days of idleness. The industries which are on the upper levels are free from all danger of floods, but some of their flumes are now in danger. Pedestrian communication with the East Sherbrooke section of the town is entirely suspended.

It is now feared that the liner will be forced further ashore and broken in two. A BIG SCHEME Toronto, June 17 The Bertram Engine Works Company, it is understood, is shortly to be reorganized with a largely increased capital and a largely increased staff of employees. It is given out that this decision has been arrived at from the fact that the company has under consideration the building of a fleet of steel freight steam vessels for the Canadian Inland Transportation Company. They are to be each 3,000 tons cargo capacity, and are intended to carry grain from the head of the lakes to Montreal and Quebec for ocean transshipment. They will be constructed of a size concomitant with that of the Welland Canal. The transportation company intends also to build grain elevators, as well as terminal facilities. Two vessels of the fleet are expected to be ready for service in the spring.","The ants appeared to be ordinary little black ants with the exception of being provided with wings.

We hope the roads will be cleared tomorrow and that people will come out and have some fun, Huneault said. The northeastern United States was also hit hard by the storm, which made its way up the Atlantic seaboard dumping up to 40 cm of snow in some regions and transforming landscapes from Virginia to Massachusetts. It disrupted air, rail and highway travel, knocked out power to thousands, closed businesses, flooded low-lying coastal areas and shut down all but emergency government services. At Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports in the New York area, scores of flights and thousands of passengers were delayed by the storm. Airports in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston also reported extensive delays due to the storm.","But in the end Igor's impact was limited, with little structural damage despite a massive loss of power that affected every corner of the island chain.

During the afternoon the storm subsided. No doubt there has been an immense amount of damage done to all outstanding crops in this district.","There is no expression to that effect in the resolution at all. As an individual I quite agree with the Dairy Commissioner's remarks, and I think I would be voicing the sentiment of the association, although I have not their authority to mention it, but we have not asked for branding to be made compulsory. We simply wish that some action should be taken to allay these unpleasant situations. ""I don't believe in making it an offense to leave cheese unbranded."" When I first came to Canada, as I said before, we received instructions to leave off the date.

None of them blamed Air Canada for the delays in getting them home, but they all said more could be done to reassure stranded passengers. There doesn't seem to be much of an attempt to keep us informed, Tennant said. Roch said Dorval should be back to normal soon, depending on how long it takes other airports to clear out their stranded passengers. Air Canada was the airline most affected by the storm. Its officials said the situation was unfortunate, but there was little they could do for stranded passengers. We're certainly empathetic with the frustration that people feel when they're at airports and waiting and not knowing what's going on, said John Hamilton, a spokesman for the airline. About the best we can say is that it's Canada in the wintertime and we are subject to the vagaries of storm weather.","The railways labored under considerable difficulty, too, in handling the traffic in the yards. The wind having banked the snow up in places over the sidings, it was necessary to shovel the tracks clear, to get at cars which were wanted for immediate use. The superintendents of the several divisions within the storm radius were working in some cases all the preceding night to keep the yards in a condition to allow the railway traffic to go on. Trains coming in through the New England States seemed to suffer the worst, and some of these lines were almost impassable.

Now the tubes of fire are turned towards the walls till they burned and the leader with a shout that rises clear above the rout bends the order high and higher, ""Men of Fire, Nigh and higher; draw your lines, storm yon walls, burst your way into the halls, prove if we can fight with fire.""","The rescued people suffered terribly from cold during the night, owing to the unheated condition of the cars. A train on the North Kent railroad, bound for this city, was snowed up last night and still remains in the rail cut, where it was stopped by a drift. A number of engines have been sent to the scene, but they have been unable to move the train. A Mail Car Lost The Sheeuse's mail car cannot be found. It has been lost somewhere along the line of the railroad between this city and Sheerness. A searching party sent out after the missing mail car rescued the clerk. He was found half frozen in a snowdrift. Two clergymen were snowed up in a carriage on the Faversham road last night, and were rescued with difficulty after having suffered severely. Reports from the provinces show that the blizzard prevailed from the St. George's channel to the North Sea. One of the effects of the storm has been the stoppage of the South Wales Iron Works. All road traffic is stopped, and the trains there are delayed. In Somersetshire, Dorsetshire, Hampshire and Gloucestershire there are snowdrifts everywhere many feet deep, rendering field work impossible."
"How did the snowstorm impact train operations and human health in the areas mentioned, particularly in terms of accidents and emergency services?","As much as $91 billion a year a groundbreaking federal study says. The research paper pegs the price of Canada's 1994 jobless rate of 10.4 per cent at $29 billion to $77 billion in lost productivity and another $14 billion in health crime and other social costs. The figures indicate Canada with an unemployment rate stuck at around 10 per cent this year once again stands to lose tens of billions of dollars to joblessness. The Human Resources Department study takes a rare look beyond the direct productivity costs of unemployment to measure the toll on physical and mental health marriages and communities. ""We have to take account of those costs when we are talking about unemployment,"" said study author Marcel. Bedard, a researcher with the federal department, reviewed existing research and discovered, if not a certain link, strong indications that unemployment can cause higher levels of illness, premature death and crime. Experts agree on the reasons: Malnutrition among the poor, resulting in chronic disease. Generally higher stress levels in low-income groups, associated with mental disorders, alcoholism, suicide, accidents, heart disease and other illnesses due to high blood pressure. The unemployed are not the only ones to suffer the consequences of these problems, says Bedard's study, completed in June.","P. R. for North Ontario, but that the appointment will not be made till after the close of the session. The Credit Valley ran trains over the new track into the city for the first time today. Today was the seventh day of the hearing of the case against the Georgian Bay Transportation Co. It is expected that all the evidence will be in tomorrow, and that the counsel will address the jury on the following day. There being very little wind stirring this afternoon, the ice-boat regatta was postponed till tomorrow. There are nine entries, with six prizes offered. Mr. Earnest E. Thompson, of Toronto, who took the gold medal at the Ontario School of Arts in 1870, has, after passing a successful examination, been admitted a student at the Royal Academy, at London, England. The Legislature is being flooded with petitions for the extension of the Saturday night law, which continue to be received by the licensed victuallers here from all parts of the Province. About 250 more are exported. Two informations were today lodged against George Adams, a pawnbroker. Both accuse him of a violation of the statute in that he charged and collected from Fred.","Several school children who started for school yesterday morning and two teamsters who drove into the country are missing, and it is feared they are victims of the blizzard. At West Duluth yesterday the smokestack of Mirrills & King's saw-mill blew down, killing F. Cullen and injuring two others. It is feared there will be much suffering if not loss of life before the storm is over. To the East Zero, St. Paul, March 10. After raging with terrific fury for thirty-four hours, the blizzard passed on to the northeast, leaving in its wake intense cold, the mercury early this morning reaching 10 below. As fuller details of the storm are received it grows in magnitude and intensity, and fears are expressed that there may be greater loss of life. On account of the bad shape the wires are in and the drift-covered country roads the full details of the loss of life will be slow in coming in, but that there have been serious results of this storm is undoubtedly true. Damage to property from the severity of the gale is reported very great at Fargo, Crookston, and other places."
"How has the severe weather described in the passage impacted the health and safety of the poorly clad and half-housed people on the big prairie north of Wabash, and what specific conditions are contributing to their suffering?","The soil had been rather unskillfully prepared for the little crop which they had put in the ground, and in many instances, owing to the abnormal drought of the summer, they received no return whatever, while the average crop all over was poor, especially potatoes. A great majority of the half-breeds were then, as already stated, engaged in freighting, which furnished only a mere sustenance for the summer, leaving nothing laid by for the winter. WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM? Mr. Burgess continues: The reports received through the Northwest Mounted Police officers from time to time during the winter show that there has been some actual destitution amongst these people, which in every instance has been relieved as seemed most fitting under the circumstances; but I have no doubt, from what I saw and heard and in view of the severity of the winter weather, that there must also have been a good deal of real hardship of which we have not heard.","This will give a clear road west of Cisco. On the Oregon and California road very little progress has been made. Truckee, Cal., January 23. The storm commenced again yesterday morning. The wind blew a gale all day. At Truckee and Cisco the snowfall is reported the heaviest of any day since the storm began. It was snowing and blowing hard in the mountains last night. Portland, Ore., January 23. The Union Pacific road is all open according to the latest reports. Snow commenced falling here last night and has continued at intervals during the day. Along the Southern Pacific there are indications of a breaking up of the blockade. Tacoma, Wash., January 21. The first train in ten days over the Union Pacific railroad arrived here yesterday. Passengers report a snow blockade near Baker City, Ore., where eight passenger trains were snowed in, the first one having been caught Sunday a week ago. The passengers report a terrible experience, three persons having died during the blockade, and a number of women and children being taken sick and receiving no other attention than that extended by their fellow passengers. BECOMING NEVADA. January 23.","A Falkland, Dak., special says six persons are known to have perished during the storm near there and there are unverified rumors of six or seven other deaths. Belgrade, Mont., reports rumors of cowboy fretting in the Madison Valley. CATTLE NOT SCATHING. Denver, Col., January 10. Saturday night was one of the coldest ever known in the Rocky Mountain country. The body of an unknown man was found frozen to death near Akron. Prominent citizens have no serious reports from the ranges, and think the cattle loss will be slight unless higher winds prevail and the snow drifts more heavily. APPARENTLY FROM KANSAS CITY, January 16. Saturday and Sunday nights were the coldest ever experienced in this section. A few cases of freezing have been reported here, but the reports that come from eastern Texas are appalling. The blizzards that raged through that section a few weeks ago left the people in such bad condition that they were unable to stand the severe weather of the past twenty-four hours and a large number of deaths from cold and starvation occurred. A carload of provisions was started yesterday from Wichita to Ashland, but the storm stopped the train."
"How has the severe snowstorm specifically affected the transportation infrastructure and agricultural market supply in New York City, as described in the passage?","He then stepped out of the door and the explosion occurred. ""Was Mr. Laidlaw between you and the man?"" was asked. ""Oh, no, sir. He was at the other end of the table."" ""Did you shake hands with him or hold his hand?"" ""No; I never touched him."" Dr. Ludowic Gray, an expert, was then called to tell about the examination of Norcross' brain. Dr. Gray thought that the brain of Norcross showed evidence of trouble, but that there was nothing in the brain to show insanity. The affidavits of the father and mother of Norcross were then read to the jury in order to establish fully the identification. The jury then rendered a verdict that Henry L. Norcross came to his death by dropping a dynamite bomb from his own hand in Michael Sage's office on December 4th, 1901, and that Richard Norton was accidentally killed in the explosion. THE STORM SOUTH OF US. Syracuse Cut Off From All Communication With Outside Points. Gale In New York. Syracuse, March 10. The wind and snowstorm which set in in this city yesterday afternoon developed into a blizzard which today laid a complete embargo on traffic and business.","News of a heartrending nature was received last night from Elousic, ten miles from here. Yesterday morning Mrs. Peter Bertin started to attend divine service at 10 o'clock, leaving in the house three children. When the people were returning from church they discovered that Bertin's house was nearly burned to the ground. The first man reaching the building found the eldest child, a girl of thirteen, burning to death, and after several attempts succeeded in extricating her by the hair. Her legs were entirely burned. She lived only three hours in terrible pain. The remains of a younger sister were found burned to a crisp in the building. The other child of the family, a boy, had left the house early in the morning, and thus escaped. The father of these children was frozen to death in the woods in January last. The Crop Damaged. Lincoln, Neb., March 20. The storm that has been general over Nebraska for the last twenty-four hours has been unusually severe. Winter grains are undoubtedly injured and the outlook for fruit in this state is poor. Chicago, March 26. Despatches from points in northern Illinois and Iowa report the prevalence yesterday of a severe sleet storm. Great damage to wheat and fruit is feared.","London is now relatively the cheapest market in the world. Our classed flour is a perfect drug, as common wheats are so extremely cheap. New Zealand, in fair condition but somewhat grown, are selling at from 32s down to 26s per 496 pounds, and good East Indian wheats at 34s per 496 pounds in perfect condition. From Glasgow Flour is being slaughtered right and left. One thousand sacks straight Minnesota were sold yesterday at 29s per 280 pounds, usual credit terms. Other kinds are selling in the same proportion. A large quantity of flour is held here by parties who cannot finance it themselves, and it will be thrown onto the market very soon if things do not take a turn. From Newcastle Supplies of wheat and flour are greatly in excess. All late shipments into this market will lose heavily. Chicago, January 27. The last week was less favorable to the railroads centering in Chicago from the agricultural district. The scarcity of storage prevented the chief grain-carrying roads from accepting such freight when consigned to Chicago elevator."

It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity.","Regular blizzard. Could have not been worse. Electric road a signal success. Cars running uninterruptedly.

""I DUVENPORT TRIBUNE, Jan 9, 1881, (Morning paper): Where are the croakers now? Yesterday morning when the rain ceased, the street and hills became coated with ice, then it was doubtful to many if the cars would be able to ascend the Brady Street hill, but they did not remain long in doubt, for the Electric cars went up and down the hill at their usual speed. When the first car started over the line, an interesting pyrotechnic display appeared on the Trolley wire: the passage of the current melting the ice and emitting a bluish flame. As we are likely to have a snowstorm this evening or tomorrow, our citizens will get an opportunity of judging how it operated in deep snow.","THE RAILWAYS BLOCKADED New York Has to Go Back Ten Years for a Storm as Big and Boston to 1881 for a Comparison New York, November 27 When the people of New York awoke this morning they found the blizzard that raged when they retired was still in progress The storm, which had begun with the soft, sleety snow on Saturday, at noon had increased greatly, and with the heavier snowfall, the wind was blowing gale at midnight There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end With the brightening of the skies in this city, this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic"

As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable.","TAKING THE WEATHER IN STRIDE A woman crosses the slushy downtown intersection after the season's first major snowfall. METROPOLITAN NEWS: Andy Riga Tramways in the snow, AMT train troubles and language watchdogs. Excerpts from our blog and Twitter feed about Montreal: How would tramways have fared in this week's snowstorm? Whenever the topic of returning tramways to Montreal streets comes up, someone mentions our city's rough winters. The issue surfaced recently when I wrote about a Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal public-transit study. At a news conference, Board of Trade chief executive Michel Leblanc questioned whether streetcars are a good idea, considering our snow, ice and cold weather. That story prompted Avrom Shtern, the transportation spokesperson at the Green Coalition, to write to me. ""The Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal discredits itself by saying streetcars and related light rail may not be suited to Montreal's winters. They have ignored history. Montreal's tramways had operated in the harshest of conditions and were much more reliable in snow and ice than buses."""
What specific impact did the snow have on the mail train from Boston and subsequent mail delivery as reported by the superintendent of mails in the general Post Office?,"Temperature at morning was zero. Chicago, February 13 The storm broke into operations of roads throughout Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska. At this point, however, the storm was comparatively mild. No trains arrived at or departed from Council Bluffs. Within 100 miles of Chicago, west and northwest, there was no considerable trouble. Large gangs of men were sent out equipped with necessary implements for clearing the cut, but the storm followed their track fast and furious. Thirty miles east of here there was no trouble, but the snowstorm was severe in Iowa. The Rock Island is blockaded in Western Illinois and Iowa. Several trains were buried at Geneseo, and this was also the case along the lines to Kansas City and Council Bluffs. No evening trains were started on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. All freight trains except those carrying live-stock were abandoned. The Illinois Central suffered severely in this state and Iowa. St. Paul, Minn, February 13 This seems to have been the cradle of the storm. In some of the cuts on the railroads the snow is from 30 to 40 feet in depth.","As a result, the police courts today were crowded with eminently respectable looking persons who were let go with a small fine and an admonition to get in out of the snow.

The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly.","Petersen, from New York, January 25, for St. John's, with a general cargo, is visible in an ice floe off Ferryland, thirty miles south of this port. She is flying distress signals and it is feared that she has been seriously injured and crushed by the ice. THE UPPER PROVINCES Montreal Appears to Have Got Off Lightly Nearly all trains reaching Montreal were more or less interfered with by snow blockades yesterday. This the railway men attributed more to the high winds which accompanied the storm than the snowstorm itself. It was the piling of the snow into cuttings, and in spots where the wind got a good chance to operate on, that caused the blockades, and this was more due to the snow which fell on Sunday week than to the storm of yesterday. The railways labored under considerable difficulty, too, in handling the traffic in the yards. The wind having banked the snow up in places over the sidings, it was necessary to shovel the tracks clear, to get at cars which were wanted for immediate use. The superintendents of the several divisions within the storm radius were working in some cases all the preceding night to keep the yards in a condition to allow the railway traffic to go on."
"What measures did the police implement in response to the snowstorm, and what were the consequences of these measures on the individuals brought to the police courts?","The downtown core was plunged into darkness, trains had stopped running because of downed lines across their tracks, Montreal's three main bridges to the South Shore were closed and vital supplies were threatened.

That same evening the streets were almost impassable, the rain having washed the ice smooth, but no one seemed to pay any attention to the order, and the consequence was that pedestrians were going down like ninepins.

This storm has since spread all over the Western states, going as far south as St. Louis, where the phenomenal fall for that latitude of four inches of snow was recorded. Chicago's winds never blew before as they did yesterday and from all points in the Western states come the same reports of unprecedented snowfalls and heavy winds.

The largest halibut in the lot weighs one hundred and seventy-five pounds and measured 6 feet 4 inches in length. This result of the fishing of a small party for so short a time must open the eyes of our Atlantic fishermen and there seems to be no doubt that the most abundant results may be expected from the exploration of our fisheries on the Pacific coast. It is probable that those fisheries may not prove even second to our wonderful mineral deposits in their value to the country. The Work of the Blizzard.

The rain fell steadily all day and made outdoor life more than unpleasant. Consequently, nobody stirred out unless it was absolutely necessary. All outdoor labor was stopped, and it will take the shipping interests and the road contractors considerable time to recover from the damage done. One feature of the heavy rainfall was that it gave the Road Department considerable trouble. Mr. St. George said yesterday that the department had never had a worse experience in getting the water away through the sewers than during that rainfall. The William Street sewer, with which there had been no trouble previously, could scarcely carry off the flow. Some of the other sewers were also choked up."

Mr. Healy, in his address, said the Prince of Wales was coming ostensibly to see the country. It would be better if he visited the huts of the evicted families whom the league was supporting instead of peering at the landlords' houses. He regretted that the gentleman who was destined to be king of Ireland (great uproar and shouts of ""Never"") should be so ignorant of public feeling in Ireland as to visit Dublin Castle and cause Irishmen to attribute to him a desire to prop up Earl Spencer's filthy sceptre and whitewash Dublin Castle and to connect him with the murder of Joyce and Haynes. Healy concluded by assuring the Prince that while wishing him a pleasant voyage and plenty of amusement, his visit would leave no political effects whatever. The Germanic experience.

She conversed with General Lord Kitchener on the subject during his recent visit to Her Majesty, and she expressed the hope of living to see it carried through. The dislike of the Queen for the late William K. Gladstone was well known, but since the death of the great statesman Her Majesty has given several proofs of her kindly regard for Mrs. Gladstone, the widow. She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks. There is some discussion this week as to whether the Queen will again go to the south of France next spring, in view of the Anglophobe feeling excited by the Fashoda dispute.","These outbursts on the part of the French newspapers are having a certain effect, and letters are appearing in the English newspapers urging that pressure be exercised in the proper quarters to induce the Queen not to go to the French Riviera, but to go to Florence instead.

Boston, December 26. The snowstorm which began here about 10 o'clock this morning continued with increasing violence until 7 o'clock this evening. No accidents have been reported and although the storm has raged with great severity along the coast no marine disasters have been announced. The storm was general throughout New England and reports come from various points of drifted roads and delayed trains. Several trains are reported stalled on the Boston and Maine Railway in Maine and a train is stalled at Stratham, N.H. December 26. The railroad matters in this vicinity are greatly disunited by the storm. There is a block on the West Shore Railway between this city and Kingston that affected all the evening trains. The trains on the Erie branch are running five hours late. The New York and New England trains are three hours late.","The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn street at Van Buren. The effect of others kept them within sheltering doorways. Civilians and policemen became a volunteer brigade, and on the principle that in union there is strength, they locked arms with the belated police workers and crossed in safety. At the stockyards there was a practical suspension of business all the morning. No buyers were to be seen. Stock trains were late, and when they did arrive were covered with snow. In the suburbs the storm was felt with rather more severity than in the heart of the city. One of the big front windows of the Leland hotel was blown in early this morning at the very beginning of the storm. The glass was blown clear across one of the parlors by the force of the wind, but the window was boarded up before any serious damage was done by the snow. The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day.","Petersen, from New York, January 25, for St. John's, with a general cargo, is visible in an ice floe off Ferryland, thirty miles south of this port. She is flying distress signals and it is feared that she has been seriously injured and crushed by the ice. THE UPPER PROVINCES Montreal Appears to Have Got Off Lightly Nearly all trains reaching Montreal were more or less interfered with by snow blockades yesterday. This the railway men attributed more to the high winds which accompanied the storm than the snowstorm itself. It was the piling of the snow into cuttings, and in spots where the wind got a good chance to operate on, that caused the blockades, and this was more due to the snow which fell on Sunday week than to the storm of yesterday. The railways labored under considerable difficulty, too, in handling the traffic in the yards. The wind having banked the snow up in places over the sidings, it was necessary to shovel the tracks clear, to get at cars which were wanted for immediate use. The superintendents of the several divisions within the storm radius were working in some cases all the preceding night to keep the yards in a condition to allow the railway traffic to go on."

THE GRAIN BLOCKADE. What a Veteran Traveller has to say from Personal Experience. James Parkyn, a good Liberal, says the Hamilton Spectator, has just returned from an extended trip in the Northwest in the interests of James Turner & Co., of this city. He reports business generally quiet, as is to be expected at this season of the year; but all look forward to a good spring and summer trade. Mr. Parkyn, who has had twenty-three years' experience in the grain trade, says it is marvelous the way the Canadian Pacific Railway has handled so much of last season's grain crop considering all the difficulties the company has had to contend with. The great cause of the delay in getting cars through is the unusually heavy snowfalls this winter north of Lake Superior. For some 1100 miles along the railway, the snow is from four to six feet deep on the level and the oldest inhabitants declare that they have not seen the like for twelve years. Another cause of complaint is the failure of the grain dealers to provide storage at the various stations where they purchase so as to take proper care of the grain as it is brought to market.","Temperature at morning was zero. Chicago, February 13 The storm broke into operations of roads throughout Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska. At this point, however, the storm was comparatively mild. No trains arrived at or departed from Council Bluffs. Within 100 miles of Chicago, west and northwest, there was no considerable trouble. Large gangs of men were sent out equipped with necessary implements for clearing the cut, but the storm followed their track fast and furious. Thirty miles east of here there was no trouble, but the snowstorm was severe in Iowa. The Rock Island is blockaded in Western Illinois and Iowa. Several trains were buried at Geneseo, and this was also the case along the lines to Kansas City and Council Bluffs. No evening trains were started on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. All freight trains except those carrying live-stock were abandoned. The Illinois Central suffered severely in this state and Iowa. St. Paul, Minn, February 13 This seems to have been the cradle of the storm. In some of the cuts on the railroads the snow is from 30 to 40 feet in depth.","The lust of lucre was entering humanity, born of extravagance.

The wind reached its maximum velocity at 11:00 a.m., when it registered 35 miles an hour. From all parts of the surrounding country come reports of great damage, and in many cases serious inundations, families on the coast and near the rivers being driven to the two storeys of their houses by the rising waters. Great fears are entertained for the coasting fleet and other ships in the neighborhood. In various parts of the country railroad traffic has been suspended by washouts. At Westchester the tide reached a higher point than ever before known.

This afternoon a telephone service as far as Worcester was established. Most all of the business districts of this city were deserted all day. The stock exchange was lifeless, and transactions were very limited, chiefly due to the absence of news from the New York Stock Exchange. Shipping in the harbor was considerably damaged during last night and the early morning. It is feared that many disasters to coast shipping will be reported when telegraphic communication is restored. The center of the storm appeared to be in the vicinity of New Bedford and the brunt of it fell on Boston and territory within a radius of fifteen to twenty miles. From meager reports received from the middle and western parts of the state the storm was less severe.

STARVATION IN INDIA II Ills of Averting a Famine in Some Districts Abandoned - Neither Feed Nor Water for Cattle Madras, August 6 Though the monsoon set in some time ago in some parts of India, dispelling all fears of a failure of crops in that portion of the country where the rains had fallen, there has been no rain in the Thingleput and North Arcot districts and all hopes of averting the famine have been abandoned. The heat is unprecedented, the standing grain and other crops have succumbed to the long drought and all are withered and turned. Already the effects of the scarcity of food are being felt and there is great suffering among the inhabitants of those districts.","A heavy snowstorm prevailed throughout the night in Devonshire and Cornwall, considerably adding to the difficulties of the farmers of those counties and still further impeding the resumption of traffic on the railroads of the southwest. As for the country roads they are utterly impassable, huge snowdrifts completely preventing any communication between towns and villages. This state of affairs naturally is very severe on numerous villages which depend almost entirely upon the towns in their neighborhood for supplies of food and fuel. In fact, in the case of a number of these small villages their isolation is already causing considerable anxiety, as actual starvation stares them in the face should the weather not moderate shortly sufficiently to allow them to be re-victualed. Reports in that direction are already being made, but the snowstorms impede the work of rescue, for such, in fact, it is. In addition to the enormous losses suffered by the farmers in sheep and cattle, which have either frozen to death in the fields or which have been smothered beneath the mountain-cur snowdrifts to be found on all sides, large numbers of horses have perished in a like manner.","But the retreat, through the snow and cold of winter, was an utter tragedy. A campaign that began with 423,000 combatants dwindled to 50,000 by its end, an ""army of ghosts."" Soldiers suffered from winter mirages. Cold temperatures, coupled with reductions in visibility by blowing snow - including the inability to distinguish between snowpacks and leaden skies - led hallucinating souls into the wintry unknown, never to be seen again. Makeshift bridges were constructed over rivers by engineers, in inclement conditions, to make safe passage. But sometimes they collapsed or were bombed, with hundreds drowning or freezing to death.

They contended that the city should share their ""bad luck"" on the ground that they were civic employees. Some of them stated that other men had been appointed to supersede them and were now working in certain specified streets. Aid.

Alberta Oil Discovery started Montreal East on way down Montreal's decline Robert W. Scott's Jan. 21 letter blaming the decline of Montreal on the lack of foresight of the anglophone community is partially correct. However, two major events probably played a much greater role in the decline. Firstly, the discovery of oil in Alberta in the mid-1940s started Montreal East on its catastrophic decline. Until then, with oil just over 200 miles away by pipeline, Montreal East was Canada's third-ranked manufacturing centre. Secondly, the seaway coming into existence in the early 1960s benefitted the rest of Canada but severely diminished Montreal's traditional importance as Canada's transportation hub. Obviously, the subsequent political developments did nothing to stop the economic rot."
What specific impact did the snowstorm have on the Canada Atlantic train according to the passage?,"On the cross streets between St. Henri and Victoria square, passenger and vehicular traffic was simply impossible. In the early morning the good people started in to clear the track; it was a veritable case of love's labor lost. The snow fell; it was increasing. They gave it up in despair and resigned themselves to the inevitable. People floundered through the narrow margin of a sidewalk left for them to tread; they rushed in despair to the Street Railway track, only to fall in a heap on the snowy embankment on either side on the approach of a car, laboring under difficulties itself. There was no pleasure here, there or anywhere. There appeared to be nothing but snowflakes, which fell and whirled around in most fantastic shapes. It was a good old-time Canadian snowstorm, the like of which has not been seen during the last two decades. ON RAILROAD LINES Surprisingly Little Difficulty in the Handling of Trains.

In discussing the big storm, Mr. Spencer said that all the trouble seemed to be near Lachute, where snow banks were encountered from four to ten or twelve feet high. During the afternoon, however, the blockade was raised and the Winnipeg train reached Windsor depot at 4 o'clock. The telegraph reported that the weather around the north of Lake Superior was exceedingly fine for the time of year, and this was confirmed by the fact that the ""Soo"" train was on time when the Lachute obstruction was reached. The ""Soo"" train and Winnipeg express outward were dispatched as soon as the road was cleared. The Quebec train also left last evening at the usual hour, while the Ottawa trains were set in motion as soon as the Lachute drifts were got out of the way. The trains on the Atlantic and western sections were running on time and do not appear to have been interfered with.","We are always ready to attend for orders on any occasion, or on regular days, to any part of the city.

Herve Bertrand recounted being repeatedly beaten and raped by a security guard at another institution, starting at age 11. Medical records seemed consistent with that account, referring to ""multiple boils around the anus"" and ""edema near the anus."" Clarina Duguay told of being sexually molested by a nun and heavily sedated during the years she spent in a psychiatric hospital. Along with the medical records, the orphans also made public falsified documents tracing the transfer of a healthy child to a psychiatric hospital. The orphans were children born out of wedlock or in poverty who were placed in the care of religious orders in the 1940s and 1950s when Maurice Duplessis was Quebec premier and the province's education and health systems were run by Catholic orders."
"What concerns do residents have about the health impacts of dumping dirty snow in vacant lots, as mentioned in the passage?","On his next order, first was seen, ""COTTOLENE."" Ask Your Grocer for it, made only by K. H. Hutton, Captain J. Pettigrew, Capt. Lulham, Surgeons-Major Campbell and Fenwick, Surgeon Roddick and Lt.-Col. Martin. These names were picked up in less than an hour, but there is no doubt that there are a great many more. Anyone who knows of any others will confer a favor by sending them to the military editor of this paper, with the length of service, so that they can be sent to the proper authorities. A Danger to Health. Complaints have been made to Sub-Chief Lancey, and referred to the Health department, about the dumping of snow on Western park above St. Catherine street. Now that the snow has melted noxious effluvia are exhaled from the residue of garbage mixed with it. Complaints have also been made about the danger to the settling basin, wheel house and aqueduct, as the dump is near these and refuse is blown into the city's water supply.","NOT TOLD OF PLANS Last week, Montreal officials complained they hadn't been told of Outremont's plans to dump snow on the Beaubien property. Pierre-Yves Melancon of Montreal's executive committee insisted local zoning doesn't allow for that type of waste storage. Outremont leased the CP site last winter to cope with the overflow of ice and snow last winter without advising Montreal. But Melancon said that wouldn't be a practical permanent solution, since it would have an impact on Montreal's sewage system. However, opposition councillor Helen Fotopulos can't help wondering why Outremont is ready to forge ahead with the sale if Montreal won't agree to let it use the site as planned. ""Once again, they are treating us with contempt, like a Third World neighbourhood where they can dump their garbage,"" Fotopulos, who represents Mile End, can't help remembering last summer's crisis, when the city allowed a rock-crushing quarry to set up shop in the same area, a stone's throw from the schoolyard at Edouard VII - and the same site where the snow is supposed to be dumped. Residents on both sides of the municipal boundary object to the plan, citing environmental concerns and the fact they weren't informed.","How, Mr. editor, if we poor foot passengers are in danger of being run over in the middle of the road and complain of the fast trotters, we are told to ""keep on the sidewalk."" If we go where we are by law and reason and common sense allowed and supposed to go, we are told by the teamsters to ""get into the middle of the road."" I have come to the conclusion that the police force here is simply a delusion and snare. I never saw one yet where he should be, and the general opinion now is that they are of ""no use,"" and unless our excellent Mayor, Mr. Abbott, will take up this matter and give us at least some place where we can walk, I will get up petitions asking that the police force be abandoned. It was only the other day that I saw a swell tandem driven by a swell driver, going down the sidewalk of St. James street, and no policeman to interfere. Verily the taxpayers of Montreal are a long-suffering people. Yours respectfully, NO PLACE TO WALK. ""WHAT AN OBJECTIONABLE STORY."" The following is peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his good and, so far as I know, new."
How did the flood specifically affect the operations at the Custom House and the transportation methods used by the clerks to exit the building?,"THE FLOOD Traffic with Griffintown and Point St Charles Interrupted A Number of Teams Break Through the Ice on the Streets A Horse Drowned Factories Closed Down Danger of a Water Famine The prediction made in yesterday's Gazette that skating would soon be more useful than booting has been literally fulfilled within twenty-four hours, for yesterday every house in the low-lying districts had its own private skating rink, and if the people wished to attempt a more ambitious flight they had the street before them, and a flying visit on skates was quite the fashion The police, to whom the hint was more especially addressed, have, with the conservative spirit of their class, still taken no step to provide themselves with those useful articles, and a burglar armed with a pair of skates could easily leave a policeman behind, but no doubt before the week is out we will see the gallant defenders of the peace practicing the outside edge on McCord and William streets This morning Between midnight on Sunday and six o'clock yesterday morning the river suddenly fell a foot and the water receded from Commissioner street, leaving only a crust of ice, and many were the accidents to horses attached to heavy sleighs, many of which broke through In the afternoon, however, the water again began to","Her coming was announced by joyous shrieks of her steam whistles as she came up the current from Honfleur with all flags flying, closely following her was the Terrebonne. After them came the schooners Marie Adele, Eugene and Bethlehem. The Harbor Commissioners' dredges, of which a portion have already left Soiel, are to begin operations at once. The Lachine canal now undergoing the annual repairing will be opened the last day of the week. The ice on the wharves is fast disappearing and no considerable accumulation remains except opposite the Housecolors market. The iron railing of the revetment wall is being placed in position. Yesterday there were noticed seven small schooners, a sloop laden with hay and dredges Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; also one of the small steam tugs of the Harbor commissioners. On the river a number of parties had taken advantage of the beautiful weather and were rowing about in pleasure boats. Along the revetment wall numbers of people were observed each propounding his own particular theory for stopping the floods and preventing the ice jamming the channel.","This served to keep alive a feeling of suspense among those who had come to watch the rise and fall of the water. As it was not known at what minute the ice would come down from Lake St. Louis and precipitate a flood. In spite of the promising aspect of Commissioners street except in places where the ramps had been rather hurriedly erected, showed no signs of overflow. At the foot of St. Sulplce, St. Gabriel, St. Francois Xavier and McGill streets, however, especially in the latter locality, considerable water had come through the ramp structure, and the street was slightly overflowed in these places. The ramps near the foot of McGill street showed more leakage than the rest, because the barricading of these places was not finished until a late hour last night. During the early evening, a large number of men were engaged in filling in these structures, canvas bags filled with clay, straw and cement being used for the purpose. When finished, these ramps gave promise of being as dry as the others and even the slight overflow which was going on would be stopped. Any damage which threatened along the river front and elsewhere, resulted largely from water flowing out of the yards, but comparatively few places of flooded cellars were reported."
How did the flooding impact the operations and infrastructure of the police and fire stations in the affected area?,"""We usually see at this time of year, and the snow has been melting very fast,"" said Morin, the Pierrefonds official. Masson noted that the water level would need to reach 19.83 metres (about 64.5 feet) to cause minor flooding along the St. Lawrence River near LaSalle. Yesterday, the water level there measured 19.78 metres. ""We are watching the situation closely, because we are approaching the levels of minor flooding,"" he said. ""Unlike the South Shore, where the water levels are going down, the water in the rivers around the island keeps going up."" In Laval, police were keeping an eye on water levels around the city, especially on the western end of the island, in the Laval West, Fabreville and Sainte-Dorothee neighbourhoods. Two streets were closed yesterday. ""We're at the usual level of flooding, but it is possible the water level is a bit higher than usual,"" Laval Police Sgt. Denys Thibodeau said. ""As a consequence, we're asking people to be careful.""","William, In full sail on Wellington and St. Patrick streets. This novelty of sailing in the streets of Montreal has since been indulged in by a few who were struck with the enterprise of the occupants of the Nellie II. At six o'clock on Monday night there was three feet of water at the waterworks, St. Gabriel; at eight o'clock the machinery was in good working order and the village of St. Gabriel was supplied with water. The houses from No. 11 to 21 on George Street, Point St. Charles, are reported as being in an unsafe condition. The building inspector has been instructed to report on the state of the buildings. The sanitary inspector has also been instructed to visit the Point and make a report as to the condition of the lately submerged district. The corporation would be doing a good service if they had the fire engines pump the water out of the cellars of the houses at Point St. Charles, so that no stagnant water would remain to aid the spread of disease. The firemen of No. 2 station have done noble work in assisting the people to remove their goods to a place of safety. Fireman Hutchinson waded up to his waist in the basement of Ald.","The outbreak was discovered by Constable Joseph Hammond, of the Central station squad, while patrolling St Dizier street. He was suddenly startled by two explosions in quick succession, and running to see where it came from saw that smoke and flames were bursting from the basement windows of the above establishment. He sounded the alarm on box 313, at the corner of St Paul and St Jean Baptiste streets. The firemen met with big obstacles in the shape of the iron barred windows in the St. Rassier street side of the store. The smoke got into the three upper floors and it looked as if the whole building was on fire. The doors, front and back, were broken in and streams from reels 1, 2, 3 and 4 were pouring on the flames in the basement and ground floor. They soon made an effect and in less than half an hour the fire was out, but not before $25,000 worth of damage had been done by either fire, smoke or water. This is only an approximate estimate as the damage by smoke in the upper floors could not be ascertained."
"How did the flood, caused by the breaking-up of ice above the Lachine Rapids, specifically impact the infrastructure and human activities at the Point police station and the fire station on Centre Street?","The strength of the ice below determines the character of the flood caused by ice from the lakes above coming down to the channel, if the ice is strong below, or to force the whole away if the ice below is weak. The places where ice grounds and closes the waterway are easily seen, because of the high mounds of ice raised by the shore; at these places, I can remember one year the shove extended to shore, and did much injury to vessels, docks, etc. Another year the ice shoved from the south to the north side of the river, piling mountains high in front of the city and up on the street, damaging buildings, while the flood took the south side to St. Lambert and Longueuil till the height and force of the water opened the channel. Another year the ice shoved to the south, from the Lachine Rapids to the shoals above the Victoria Bridge, attending to the south embankment, and piled upon it about sixteen feet above the track and blocked the traffic, and caused a flood at Laprairie and Lower Lachine.","The strength of the ice below determines the character of the flood caused by ice from the lakes above coming down to the channel, if the ice is strong below, or to force the whole away if the ice below is weak.

About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water."
"What specific infrastructural damage was caused by the moving ice and accompanying flood in the area between Vaudreuil and St. Johns, and how does this compare to the flood of 1861 in terms of economic and ecological impact according to the passage?","It is admitted on all sides that our annual floods are due to and are the effects of ice coming down the rapids during the winter, under running the ice in Laprairie Bay and choking up the narrow gorge below, causing the river to rise and overflow its natural bounds. In my last letter referred to, I quote the precise words of a report signed in 1887 by four engineers as to this fact. I will, in this letter, give quotations from a report of the Royal Engineers to Lord Sydenham in 1841, wherein you will find a perfect agreement with the opinions of engineers of the present day as to the cause of our floods, and as a remedy how strongly they condemned the idea of interfering with its natural course. In his report on the ""St. Lawrence bridge and manufacturing scheme,"" engineered by Mr. Shearer, Mr. Kennedy says: ""In investigating the practical consequences of ice jams, as distinct from their causes, it appears at once that it is only the floods which accompany the jams that are of Burtons importance; the movements of the ice itself, for the most part, occur within well-known limits and are easily guarded against, but the floods extend over great and indefinite areas and work serious damage.""","W. ""Tirmull was burned, and apparently a supply of costly rhubarb and other feathers stolen. The detectives are working up the case."" Mr. Kutner, in Varin, assistant clerk of the Court of Appeals, died yesterday morning. He had been employed in that office since 1870. The deceased was very popular among the lawyers. The Civic Flood Relief Committee met yesterday morning and shared a number of accounts. That of Mr. Hrmhes for tea, bread, and sugar was reduced from $11.50 to $10.37. THE FLOODS TO THE EDITOR OF THE GAZETTE: Your correspondent Reform had the kindness to mention my name when writing on the flood question. This needs some notice from me inasmuch as I devoted much time and attention to the various causes and effects of floods. The ice shoves and formation of ice dams on shoals and narrow channels were fully calculated as may be seen by surveys taken at my request years ago.

"What specific areas in the city have been newly affected by the floodwaters, and how has this impacted the infrastructure such as streets and cellars?","Volumes of steam are coming up through the tarpaulin on the hatches, and the deck and sides of the steamer are extremely hot. Port Warden Hunter made an examination of the ship this afternoon, but it has not yet been decided whether to flood the holds or keep on injecting steam. If the holds are flooded, it means the damaging of over five hundred tons of grain, which is stored underneath the cotton in the fore hold. PRICE TWO CENTS A DISASTROUS GALE Immense Damage Has Been Done in Great Britain PROPERTY LOSS VERY LARGE Floods Are Reported From Many Towns in the South Storm Also Felt on the Continent London, January 13 Widespread devastation on land and sea has been the result of the recent storm, and the aggregate losses of property are immense. This evening reports are gradually filtering through from the provinces, telling of dismantled houses, overflowing rivers, inundated streets and fields, buildings flooded, cattle and sheep drowned, railroads disorganized, and disasters to life and limb from falling debris. London's parks and buildings have suffered heavily. The Thames has overflowed along the upper reaches, with serious loss to the dwellers on the banks. Most of the coast towns have suffered severely.","HOSTOCAL Telephone No. 426 878 GREAT DAMAGE BY FLOODS In the New England States and Pennsylvania, and further north the telephone and telegraph wires are all down. At Peabody, Mass, for 600 yards, the Main street is under water to the depth of thirty-eight inches. Over twenty tenements are flooded, and several families have been rescued in boats. At Hudson, Mass, the Assabet river has overflowed, carrying off most of the bridges between Westport and Hudson, railway travel is suspended. Trains on the Fitchburg road are feeling their way through several inches of water. Many other cities and towns are reported under water. The Highland skating rink, the finest in Boston, was submerged this morning and the costly decorations and beautiful floor were ruined. The damage will be many thousands in the Boston Highlands district, the Westminster apartment hotel will be a complete wreck. Dwellings on the flooded streets are mostly three-storey marble fronts, and as the ground had already settled greatly before the flood it is probable that most of this section will have to be rebuilt. The residents for upwards of a mile are living in the upper storeys, which are reached only by boats.","If the tariff were increased the business would increase, domestic competition would arise and prices would consequently fall. On the other hand, if the tariff were reduced many of the American potteries that were now struggling for existence would have to succumb and close their doors. About the middle of last month Lombardy was the scene of storms of wind, rain and hail, accompanied, in some cases, with shocks of earthquake, which carried devastation far and wide. Such a disastrous combination of weather phenomena had not, it was said, been known within the memory of persons living there. Several of the rivers and streams overflowed their banks, and a desolating flood, destructive to the vine, rice and other crops, overspread the fields. The country watered by the Mella has suffered terribly, and at Hencadulls the scene is that of rich and fertile lands suddenly transformed into a wilderness. Around Brescia, Mortara, Bobbio and other centers of population, the peasants are in great distress, their crops, in many instances, being almost completely ruined. Some of the lines of railway were seriously damaged, traffic on parts of the Milan-Locca road being entirely suspended. Not far from Bergamo a bridge was swept away."
"What specific challenges did the Central fire station on Craig Street face during the flooding, and how did the firemen adapt to these conditions according to the passage?","The cellar of No. 1840 Ontario street must have been filled ten minutes after the break. The different householders, unfortunate enough to be on the route, just left the cellars of their houses without, in many cases, being able to save the furniture. The streets in the neighborhood were crowded at the time of the break, with people returning home from the theatres, and soon the greatest excitement prevailed, many householders rushing down to their cellars to inspect their condition. On the line of Bleury street, however, between the break and Ontario street, not much damage was done, and on inquiry it was learned that here at least the basements and cellars were dry. At the corner of Ontario street the water was over two feet in depth, and flowed in large volume along that thoroughfare, completely stopping all traffic and flooding the low-lying sections to a great depth. At this point, the men of the Water department were early on the scene and commenced preparations for shutting off the water, which proved to be no easy task, and it was after one o'clock this morning before the flow was checked.","The cellar of No. 1840 Ontario street must have been filled ten minutes after the break.

It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street."
"What specific challenges did the flooding present to the Central fire station and its personnel, and how did these challenges impact the firemen’s ability to respond effectively?","The uncertainty of our northern route will ever be a barrier to fast sailing ships. A Building for Records. The Government will shortly take action in the direction of putting up a new building to be devoted to the especial purpose of holding Canadian public records of all departments. Mr. Tarte is understood to favor the plan. Last evening Mr. Tarte and Acting Chief Architect Ewart went over a proposed site down at the foot of Parliament Hill, near the electric light station. It has been suggested for the purpose that many think that if any new structure is put up it should be on Parliament Hill, where it would add to the beauty of the pile already standing there. The Minister of Public Works is being very strongly urged to look into the desirability of replacing the Canadian Geological Museum Building on Sussex Street with a permanent and suitable office where the treasures of the Institution could be considered safe. This will receive consideration, too, and an appropriation may be asked to cover the purpose indicated. Cause of the Fire. Mr. Ewart, Acting Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works, has made a report on the fire in the western block to Mr. Tarte, in which he gives details of the fire, which agree in the main with those already published.","""But when it came down to the hockey, absolutely nothing was planned in advance,"" he said. ""Nobody knew anything, nobody expected anything, and our fire trucks downtown found themselves paralyzed, unable to move, unable to respond efficiently and (firefighters were) intimidated when it came to putting the car fires out."" ""And when the city finally woke up in the middle of the night and went to Station 25 on Drummond St and said: 'We're going to have to pull you out of there because you're going to be in trouble,' the guys said: 'Forget about it, we're already in trouble. We're not going outside. We're surrounded by people.'"" ""Fire trucks and firefighters became the targets of bricks and other missiles, one piece of concrete striking a firefighter in the legs,"" the union official said. ""I was on Ste. Catherine Monday night from midnight to about 2 in the morning, and that's when we realized we had to do something,"" Chris Ross said. ""Everything was burning everywhere. Our trucks were surrounded by people and were having rocks pitched on them. We should have had some sort of support from the police, but the police, as they were, were understaffed.""","CHICORY MILLS BURNED The Property of Mr. Joseph Beaubien of Outremont The Haras National not Injured The usually quiet municipality of Outremont was early as fire had broken out in the Chicory mills of Mr. Joseph Beaubien. These mills are in the rear of the Haras National stables. It was at first supposed that the fire was in the stables. This, fortunately, proved to be untrue. In the stables were twenty-one valuable stallions, and when the blaze broke out these were removed out of the stables with considerable difficulty, however, to a place of safety which was within the vast grounds. The fire was first seen in the eastern end of the building, from which came dense volumes of smoke. This was immediately followed by an outburst of flames, which assumed so serious an aspect that the city was at once communicated with and help requested. The help was at once granted by Chief Benoit sending out No. 10 engine and No. 14 reel, and had it not been for their efficient work, under Capt. Renaud, the loss would have been much more serious."

Joe Leof's being flooded out, most of his customers could be seen sitting on the doorstep looking disconsolately at the waste of waters, flowing eastwards towards Jarry Park where the bank rises. The water did not extend so far, and people were able to go down as far as Commissioners Street. The ice was not broken up nearly so much as jammed, and presented the appearance of a solid sheet, slightly roughened on top, the only evidences of shifts having taken place being the encumbrance of ice along the revetment wall and the cronkedness of the river roads. Some of these started out in a straight line, and continued so for a few hundred yards, when they suddenly stopped, and to find the continuation one had to look a quarter of a mile down stream.","Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street."
How did the flooding specifically impact the Central Fire Station on Craig Street according to the passage?,"The subscription lists are now at Nordholm's and Shoppe's, and must be closed on the 10th prox.

A SMALL FLOOD, Water Main Breaks on St. James Street and inundates Many Cellars. The water main on St. James Street, at the corner of Durling Street, burst about half-past twelve last night. The break was a very bad one, and in a few minutes the entire street in the vicinity was flooded. The inhabitants were aroused by the police and in many instances found that the water had already obtained an entrance into their cellars and basements.","W. Biltcliffe, a grocer at the corner of St. Antoine street, was the first to feel the force of the deluge, the water pouring into his cellar in a large volume. Realizing the danger, Mr. Biltcliffe at once broke open the drain, thus allowing the ever-increasing volume of water to flow freely into the connecting sewer. He estimates his loss at about $100, and is thankful that it is not more. All the cellars on the west side of Atwater avenue were more or less flooded, and even on the higher level on St. Antoine street, a few doors west of the latter thoroughfare, some of the basements were deluged, one gentleman named Miller being obliged to remove his family and household effects to drier and more congenial quarters. The worst damage, however, was done on St. James street, where the water flowed in a perfect torrent along the street railway tracks and from thence into the cellars of the houses on the south side. Traffic, as far as the railway was concerned, was completely stopped, and was not resumed until nearly midnight.","Miller, Sons & Co., 156 McGill street, also suffered considerably from the rise of water in their cellar The cellar of Messrs. Greenahields, Bon & Co., on Victoria square, was flooded to a depth of over foot, and the water was still rising Between Victoria square and St. James street West, the cellars were flooded from eighteen inches to three feet in depth Craig street residents have also felt its effects Cellars were flooded to the foot of St. Francois Xavier street, there being a little water in Kenneth Campbell & Co.'s furnace hole Messrs. W. Ewan & Son had over five inches of water in their cellar, and the water stood five or six inches deep in the furniture establishment of Mr. Wm."
"How did the flooding impact transportation and access routes in the city, specifically regarding the need for detours and alternative means of crossing flooded areas?","""We're in the middle of one of those storms that comes once in 100 years,"" Mayor Andy Wells said. ""This is without precedent. There's water in parts of this city where you'd never expect it."" Gabrielle showed up late Tuesday and gathered strength through the night. By the time the storm blew itself out yesterday, 118.6 millimetres of rain had fallen on the city. On average, the city gets about 100 millimetres each month. Lightning and powerful wind gusts were blamed for temporary power outages that blacked out much of the island earlier in the day. MAIL DELIVERY SUSPENDED The deluge prompted Canada Post to suspend mail delivery, and some house basements were filled to the ceiling, Wells said. ""If people have to move out of their houses because of the flooding, we've made arrangements to accommodate them,"" Wells said. ""We've set up our operations centre in case that materializes."" Meanwhile, many flights were delayed at St. John's International Airport and motorists were forced to plow through scores of submerged streets. ""The weather is really playing havoc with the roads,"" said Sgt. Bob Garland of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. ""Cars are stalling out in the middle of large ponds.","Sections of Truro were evacuated yesterday as the rain-swollen Salmon River overflowed its banks, causing the worst flooding in the town in more than 25 years. The situation is changing quickly, said Mayor Bill Mills. It's serious. Two boats and two buses are on standby pending an emergency evacuation order from the mayor, who urged residents in low-lying areas to leave their homes. Sixteen evacuees were taken to the Truro fire hall, and a junior high school nearby has been opened to handle any further evacuations. Floodwaters swept two women in a car off a highway, but they were pulled from their vehicle by two passers-by. An eyewitness said the water was above the vehicle's roof by the time one man reached them with a rope. All four were then trapped on the roof of the car before people on the road pulled them to safety with ropes. Rescuers were also trying to reach two men trapped in a truck surrounded by swelling waters. The flood, brought on by heavy rains and possibly a loosened ice jam in the river, caused huge traffic jams throughout the town as RCMP and Truro police closed off most streets.","Just 1.9 per cent of the 400 women polled - all age 25-65 and three-quarters of them married - said they make time for sex in the morning. This compares with 4.4 per cent who opted for doing the ironing and 35 per cent for collecting the milk from the doorstep. The remainder preferred doing their makeup. The survey also found most women still think the most romantic thing a man could do is to hold open a door or carry their bags. minutes from DECARIE Angngrtan (Meanwhile, residents and soldiers worked feverishly to fortify levees along the Yangtze, bracing for yet another flood crest forecast to sweep downriver within the next few days. Experts warned that as floodwaters recede, dikes might weaken further. Diseases also threaten, with skin infections already on the rise because people have been immersed in polluted water for weeks. ""People must wade through waist-high water to go about their daily life,"" the Red Cross reported. Ten thousand medical teams are handing out food, water purification tablets, medical supplies, and evacuating flooded areas. But shortages of funds are delaying relief efforts, the Red Cross said."
"How did the flooding impact the operations at the Grand Trunk office, and what measures, if any, were taken to maintain communication despite the inundation?","Her coming was announced by joyous shrieks of her steam whistles as she came up the current from Honfleur with all flags flying, closely following her was the Terrebonne. After them came the schooners Marie Adele, Eugene and Bethlehem. The Harbor Commissioners' dredges, of which a portion have already left Soiel, are to begin operations at once. The Lachine canal now undergoing the annual repairing will be opened the last day of the week. The ice on the wharves is fast disappearing and no considerable accumulation remains except opposite the Housecolors market. The iron railing of the revetment wall is being placed in position. Yesterday there were noticed seven small schooners, a sloop laden with hay and dredges Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; also one of the small steam tugs of the Harbor commissioners. On the river a number of parties had taken advantage of the beautiful weather and were rowing about in pleasure boats. Along the revetment wall numbers of people were observed each propounding his own particular theory for stopping the floods and preventing the ice jamming the channel.","The mechanical shops of the Grand Trunk railway were submerged and the main track this side of the Victoria Bridge submerged, compelling cars issuing from the bridge in the city to take side tracks till reaching near Wellington street. Yesterday morning, the inhabitants of ST. LAURENTVILLE never expected to be flooded, but by ten o'clock the water had risen about a foot high in the lower parts of the suburb, and by noon the whole village was inundated. The sidewalks are floating about the streets, and those who dwelt in the lower parts of tenements have had to remove all their goods and chattels to higher quarters. Business is entirely suspended and the shops closed. Horses and cattle have had to be removed from their stables, and several animals may not recover from the effects. The Grand Trunk shops are completely flooded except the blacksmith's shop, but should the water rise very much higher, business will also have to be suspended there. The depth of the water in the streets at noon was from 5 to 8 feet. Many nervous people have received a great shock by the sudden flooding of their houses. Cunegonde also suffered considerably, but the main flow of the flood seems to have been cut off from it by the Lachine canal.","Merchants, however, had taken the precaution on the breaking up of the river to remove all their damageable goods from the basement to places of safety, in the event of an overflow, and nothing remained for them to do yesterday but to calmly await developments. In the vicinity of Hochelaga, where the buildings are not protected by any earthwork, some small dwellings were more or less injured by ice and water. It was stated that the basement of the lower cotton factory had been overflowed, but it was not expected that the damage would be great, as the more expensive machinery is on the upper flats, and the water did not reach the more damageable portion of the machinery which was in that department. On Marlborough Street, the water invaded a small house, and the inmates were obliged to make rather a hasty exit with their furniture. In the western section of the city, the water also played considerable havoc although no material damage was reported. Ogilvie's mills were flooded in the basement and large gangs of men were employed on Friday and Saturday in getting the goods to the upper part of the building. In one place the water came completely over Mill Street and flowed up against the walls of the buildings at that point."
"How has the flood impacted the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sectors, specifically regarding the situation at the Grand Trunk office and the fate of livestock?","Spring wheat in Nebraska would be benefitted by rain,"" ""In Michigan and Wisconsin, all crops except corn are in fine condition,"" ""Fairly frosts, as well as too much moisture and cold weather in June, retarded that crop in these states as elsewhere,"" ""Many Wisconsin correspondents report the present condition of spring wheat and oats the best in years, but the straw in some cases is too long and heavy for the safety of the crop,"" ""In the majority of counties in Minnesota and Dakota spring wheat and oats will be almost a failure, owing to drought and hot winds,"" ""Even where the most favorable conditions exist the straw will be short and thin,"" ""The time has passed for rains to benefit these crops to any extent.",The last flood was caused by the water backing up the tail race and pouring in at the place where the embankment had been lowered to admit of the construction of the iron bridge. The bridge could be raised three feet. At other points of the embankment the water only rose to about six inches from the top. Mr. Lksags concurred in this view and it was decided to visit the spot next week.

"How has the flooding specifically impacted the infrastructure and political actions in St. Louis, as described in the passage?","K. Kenny asked the chairman of the Finance Committee if he would not grant an extension of time until the 15th of next month to poor carters to take out their licenses. Aid. Gubnik replied that in cases of poverty such extension would be granted. Aid. Donovan asked if it was intended ever to replace the sidewalks destroyed by the flood. Aid. White asked what steps had been taken with regard to level railroad crossing. Aid. Lauhknt replied that Messrs. St. George and Wanklyn had been appointed a commission to investigate and report. The twenty-second order of the day, a report of the Parks and Ferries Committee on the Richelieu & Ontario Company's offer to make certain improvements, was then disposed of, after which a by-law to amend by-law No. 65 concerning the Montreal Water Works was read.

"How did Aid. Stevenson, as chairman of the inundation committee, influence the decision-making process regarding the proposed use of dynamite to address the flood-related jam near Longue Pointe?","All trains have been shipped and washouts have occurred in several places. An unbroken is reported on the track at St. Louis, which village, or the greater part of it, is covered with water. The suburbs have suffered severely. The Gazette's press, engine and electric light rooms are five feet deep. The basement is affected in a minor degree. The Withee establishment on Bonaventure Street is surrounded by water and the cellar as well as those of other buildings in that vicinity flooded. The police station on St. Nicholas Street is in a like fix. All will, it is understood, be more or less dependent on their more fortunate rivals for assistance in making their regular appearance today. Proceeding to the riverbanks, a rumor was sent the rounds last night that an attempt would be made to start the jam which it was said existed at Longue Pointe. The name of Aid. Stevenson, chairman of the inundation committee, was mentioned as having the thing in hand and learning that the City Hall was to be made the starting point, a Gazette reporter went there.","Ald. Villeneuve said that he would not sign the report. He did not keep $200,000 in his pocket to pay for the city. His colleagues asked him whether he had any other scheme to propose. He had not. He would merely dissent. Ald. Clendinnen Well, I would rather commit an illegality than stop all the municipal services. The report carried, Ald. Villeneuve dissenting. The committee passed the report of the Roads committee for $42,000 on sewer account. This money is collectable from the proprietors. The Police Committee, contrary to expectation, the report of the sub-committee on the workings of the Detective department did not come up at Saturday's meeting of the Police committee.

Ald.","The jurisdiction of the harbour commissioners only extended to the middle of the river so that they never interfered beyond it. Mr. Nilson stated that there was a difference of only four inches on January 3rd in the level of the water between Longueuil and Hochelaga. Between Montreal and the latter point there was a fall of 3 feet 4 inches which was hardly more than normal, the fall in summer being 1 foot 3 inches. The south channel was nearly blocked up this year, there being no current to speak of and the water was forced round St. Helen's Island, and passed down opposite the city. The dam at Boucherville was over two miles in length and one mile in breadth. He considered the idea of blowing it up with dynamite impracticable, as it consisted of cakes of ice at the top and frazil below, and, with a brittle, yielding substance like this, dynamite, having no resistance, could do no good. Even if it were blown up it would jam lower down. The Chairman said they did not care what became of the ice if they only got it far enough away from the city to prevent a flood here."

Johnson called on the preacher a few days ago and told him that somebody was stealing District Attorney Angler's cow. ""Get a gun and shoot 'em"" was the preacher's advice. Johnson got a gun, and the preacher was the first person shot. Montgomery had a sack filled with roasting ears and was leaving the field when a load of lead slugs was sent after him. One slug struck him in the left breast and another in the hip. Johnson was arrested and locked up. He thinks he did a good deed.","Mr. Marceau.

We struggled with major traffic congestion every morning adding delays of 20-40 minutes to leave via Nuns' Island's only exit road.","The breaking off of small pieces of ice and the working of the eddies showed that the pressure from above had come, and that further movements of the ice are sure to take place today or tonight. The ice is not yet much honeycombed, as there has been no weather yet to bring about such a result. It has been stated by some of the oldest inhabitants, as quoted by an evening contemporary, that the temporary dyke will not go far towards preventing a flood, and one individual quoted as an authority is said to have made the statement that the dyke was an abomination, and further that if the water did not get over it, he thought it would be a practical success. This opinion is very valuable as it is exceedingly noncommittal, and is about on a par with the average opinion of the man who said if it ruined it would very probably be wet. A view from the City Hall tower yesterday afternoon did not afford much, if any, encouragement that the city would be spared an inundation. On the contrary, the indications are entirely in the opposite direction, as the few openings which have occurred in the ice are of such a nature as merely to allow the down-coming ice to gain more firmly."

One person, the explosion occurred during a performance at a circus a short distance from the residence of Canovas del Castillo. The shock was so great that it caused a part of the ceiling directly over the stalls that were occupied by a party of nobles to crash down upon the heads of the occupants of the stalls. Blinded by the dust that filled the air and with the roar of the explosion reverberating through the building, the people were panic-stricken and made a rush for the exits, trampling upon several persons in their frantic efforts to escape.

Seven other persons were also trampled upon by the crowd and seriously injured. A large number of those who escaped unaided from the building sustained painful but not dangerous injuries.","This place was visited last night by the greatest and most destructive flood ever seen in this vicinity, caused by the extremely heavy rains of yesterday. A number of mill dams north of here were washed out, swelling the river to a mighty torrent, overflowing all the flats and carrying everything before it. Many cattle and horses were swept along by the flood, two or three of which were drowned. Six or eight bridges near here have been swept away, some of them large structures. One gentleman who was on a bridge when it was swept away experienced a perilous ride for some distance, finally rescuing himself in the top of a small elm tree where he decided to abandon his lonely craft. Several boathouses and boats were also carried away. The loss will be heavy, especially in bridges. The Damage at Barrie, Barrie, Ont, June 6. The report of the great calamity here yesterday was not at all exaggerated; in fact, it was rather underestimated. From those who feel competent to judge it is now thought that the extent of the damage will reach $50,000. Tottenham, Ont, June 6. There was a washout caused by yesterday's storm between Palgrave and Caledon East."
"How did the snowstorm uniquely affect the infrastructure in the southern division of London, Ontario, and what specific ecological impacts were noted in the outskirts?","One reason, he suggested, was the fact that council had succeeded in implementing the 6-per cent payroll cuts ordered by Quebec by reducing overall spending on personnel through attrition, not by cutting salaries. Verdun's 10 city councillors now make $21,243, plus $7,376 as a non-taxable expense allowance. Their total remuneration will increase by $400. The mayor, who makes $63,103 plus an $11,420 non-taxable expense allowance, will get an additional $1,053. The increases, which apply to both amounts, are based on the Statistics Canada figure for inflation in 1997 for metropolitan Montreal. A lack of decent affordable housing is at root of problem: social-aid agencies Bosse to receive small hike. Winds cause South Shore blackouts. Yesterday's high winds caused isolated local power interruptions in areas south of the St. Lawrence River, a Hydro-Quebec spokesman said. Lucie Brodeur of the utility's Richelieu region said broken branches, pieces of roofing and siding and, in one case, a garbage-can lid struck power lines triggering circuit-breaking devices resulting in power outages.

A large hay storage barn belonging to the Rome, Watertown & Ogdensburg Railroad Company was smashed into kindling wood and piled up on the tracks. The evening train had just arrived with about two hundred people on board for Kingston, Ont. The boat succeeded in getting away from the dock with most of her passengers. With hardly any warning the depot was fairly smashed in, but luckily for those inside, windward raised, and thus many were saved from injury. The cyclone was preceded and accompanied by a remarkable electric storm. As night approached, after a very sultry afternoon, the clouds gathered ominously and flashes of lightning glimmered along the horizon in different directions. In St. Lawrence County, particularly in the vicinity of Gouverneur, the storm took the form of a flood, accompanied by a terrific electrical display.","The Pope wished to celebrate Easter mass in St. Peter's cathedral, but owing to the opposition of the Intransigents in the Sacred College the ceremony will be performed in the Basilica with closed doors.

In the immediate vicinity of Campbellford the washouts are very bad. About two miles of the track for about half a mile is submerged some two feet. The railway crosses Trout Creek, a crooked stream, about fifteen times in ten miles, and at each crossing there is a general washout.

A HEAVY STORM Does Much Damage on the Channel, in England and in France, London, November 13, The gale along the English channel last night was the most violent experienced this year. The Channel steamers report having had fearful passages. The Victoria was unable to make Dover, and returned to Calais. The steamer La Flandre was badly damaged, and many of her sailors were disabled. The barquentine Elizabeth Jane, loaded with grain, was found derelict and towed to Dover. Nothing has been heard of her crew. The warships anchored at St. Malo, France, were in serious danger and put out to sea flying distress signals. Cherbourg and other ports are crowded with damaged crafts. The steamer Preussen was torn from her moorings at Hamburg and damaged many other vessels with which she collided, although she sustained no damage herself. The storm was very violent in Paris. Much damage was done to chimneys, roofs and windows. Three persons were killed by falling chimneys, and several more were injured.

The Arroya also broke at Sprucios and in the northern part of the town, inundating the lowlands. Several houses have been reported destroyed and several persons are missing. Every house was damaged and many will fall while others are badly threatened. Hundreds of people are in distress. Relief measures have been started.","B, February 10, Yesterday's heavy snowstorm blocked almost every branch railway in the province and seriously interfered with the trunk lines. To-night a furious gale is blowing in St. John and throughout this section of New Brunswick with the mercury down below zero. The snow is drifting into large piles and is filling up railway cuttings faster than the ploughs can be operated against it. A train which left Fredericton yesterday morning only reached here to-night, and between Fredericton and Woodstock several passenger trains are stalled by the snow. Reports from many parts of the province state that this last snowfall has practically put an end to operations in the lumber woods, the snow being too deep for hauling. There is much suffering in many districts, through the highways being impassable for teams, the food supply for both animals and man being very short. Despatches from St. Stephen to-night state that the Canadian Pacific railway branch to that town is totally blockaded and like reports have come in from St. Andrew's.

The French as well as the English museums possess numerous artistic productions of that period, at the sight of which one is surprised, as in our time, and with our mechanical appliances it is hardly possible to surpass them. ""The Romans are said to have been the principal customers of the early Jewish glass makers, and with the increasing luxury of that epoch, the manufacture of glass increased, as it was not limited to the production of smaller useful objects, but also extended to the building trades. That the manufacture of glass developed in an artistic sense to the highest point need not appear wonderful, with such an extremely intelligent people as the Romans. The treasures contained in the museum of the Vatican, in the French museums, and in the British Museum bear testimony to their accomplished workmanship.

The telegraph service has never experienced such interruptions. All communication was badly interrupted. The Western Union office is entirely closed to customers and employees have a holiday. Patterson, NJ, January 20 This city yesterday found itself back in the late twenties in some respects. The heavy weight of wet snow on the hundreds of overhead wires that stretched over the principal streets pulled down scores of poles all over the town. Of the seven interurban lines in the city only two run any cars. The rest are hopelessly blocked by fallen poles and wires. New York, January 20 No traces of the snowstorm of Saturday night and yesterday morning, which played such havoc with wires, remained in the air at least today. After a beautiful moonlit night, clear and cold, the atmosphere was delightfully fresh and bracing this morning. It was not cold and the sun shone brightly. It was a pleasant winter's day in every respect save underfoot. The work of repairing the broken telephone and telegraph wires, which was begun yesterday as early as possible, continued through last night in accessible places and went on with renewed vigor this morning. The Minimum on the Jersey Coast, Exmouth, NJ, January 20 As far as can be ascertained there are no vessels ashore between here and Sandy Hook, although several have been seen about half a mile offshore. The rumor that a three-masted schooner was stranded a mile south of Point Pleasant City is erroneous. Asbury Park, NJ, January 20 The wires here are all down with the exception of those of the Electric Light Company. The surf has cut out the beach and undermined the bathing houses. Long Branch, NJ, January 20 The storm has wrought great damage along the New Jersey coast between Sandy Hook and Point Pleasant City. The surf cut into the bluff here and tore out the beach. Several houses were unroofed and signs and chimneys blown down. All telegraph and telephone wires are down and the coast cut off from communication with the railways. All trains are being run on signal and are behind time. A GENERALLY FAIR DAY, moderately cold and mild.

The wind having banked the snow up in places over the sidings, it was necessary to shovel the tracks clear, to get at cars which were wanted for immediate use. The superintendents of the several divisions within the storm radius were working in some cases all the preceding night to keep the yards in a condition to allow the railway traffic to go on. Trains coming in through the New England States seemed to suffer the worst, and some of these lines were almost impassable. The Boston train, due about 8 o'clock in the morning, was obliged to make a halting run Montrealwards, and her arrival was not looked for until a late hour last night. In the State of Vermont, the storm was raging fiercely, and the snowbanks, which had accumulated into solidly packed drifts at intervals along the track, caused the trains frequent stoppages.

According to Le Journal de Montreal's Auger, that is because it is quite clear that the presence of the Canadian armed forces has in no way been incorporated in the ministry's plans. The same theme was taken up in Le Devoir by Jean-Robert Sansfacon, who criticizes the ministry for having no plans at all. One would expect, Quebec being a country of cold and snow, that there would be a list of suppliers of high-powered generators, essential products for general distribution in case of prolonged power failures, and procedures to follow for the evacuation of households due to intense cold. How then can it be that this kind of information had to be gleaned here and there from journalists while civil authorities simply warned against the dangers of this and of that?"

"What measures did the city's emergency-measures committee implement to address the safety risks posed by the ice storm in Mount Royal Park and the other 715 parks, and how effective were these measures in preventing public access?","She said her party learned a hard lesson about emergency planning and making political decisions, like whether to ask the province to declare an official state of emergency, or whether to offer shelter to residents of other municipalities experiencing power outages. Councillor Marvin Rotrand, whose Snowdon home was one of 200,000 in the city without power yesterday, said citizens in his district were cynical about the city's ability to handle the crisis. People are questioning what the heck are we paying our taxes for, because the Bourque administration seems incapable of providing minimal services, he said. For six days we've had piles of snow in front of our home, so you know somebody is not doing their job. The city's public works department was concentrating on de-icing sidewalks and unclogging sewer openings yesterday, as well as spreading abrasives on slippery roads and sidewalks throughout the city. The city also began removing snow in the Plateau Mont Royal yesterday, after leaving heavy accumulation from last week on the street for days. Pierre Bonin, who heads the city's public works department, defended the decision to put off snow removal. He said some sidewalks that had been cleared were actually more treacherous and icy than those with some accumulation of snow.","The system also monitors individual bank accounts for unusual activity,"" said McLeod. ""The fact is there are literally millions of credit-card transactions carried out around the world every day and the vast majority of them are legitimate."" Wylie and McGill have adopted their own security measures to ensure they are not victimized again. Wylie, for instance, no longer uses his debit card for direct-payment purchases and he's very cautious about when and where he uses his credit card. The couple has also changed the way they manage their personal finances. They now have one main bank account that does not permit cash withdrawals but allows them to transfer funds to smaller satellite accounts, from which they can withdraw spending money.

Wildlife conservationists are now beginning to take stock of the impact of the recent tsunami crisis in terms of loss of wildlife. Although it is still too soon after the tragedy to make detailed assessments of how the region's birds might be affected, a preliminary study from BirdLife's scientists highlights a number of species and important areas that could suffer aftereffects. As many as 27 globally threatened bird species regularly occur in the regions and habitats of Asia potentially affected by the tsunami. There are also three endemic bird areas. However, few threatened species are likely to have been seriously affected by the direct effects of the tsunami, and no extinctions are predicted as a result. Surveys are needed to confirm the situation, though, particularly in the Nicobar islands."

But is it also a formula for the environmental equivalent of a head-on collision? ""There might be a potential for contamination that could have been recognized by the Environment Ministry and the Transport Ministry,"" said Yves Girard, head of Montreal's snow removal coordination office, referring to the Turcot site. ""But it's a site that's well waterproofed because it has been paved over - so any water, in theory, will melt toward the sewers and not into the soil."" However, the Environment Ministry's regional director for Montreal is categoric in his assessment of any risks posed by using Turcot as a snow dump. ""The snow will melt and the runoff will head into the sewer system,"" Pierre Robert said. ""Even if there were cracks in parts of the asphalt, it wouldn't be enough to create any problem. What we'll make sure of is that once the snow has melted, the city of Montreal will clean up the site and get rid of any residue that was left over from the snow."""
What specific measures are being taken to ensure the safety and stability of the stadium's roof infrastructure during the cleanup process in this exceptional weather situation?,"It appears that the contract with Birdair was well written, and that the insurance clauses are enforceable. If that proves true, and if the Americans make good on their contract somehow, it would, to my knowledge, be the first time in the long saga of the Olympic Stadium that someone, other than the taxpayers of Montreal and Quebec (in particular the smokers among them) would foot a part of the endless repair bill. The problems of the roof aside, this is a good time to give the stadium, now more than two decades old, a thorough health check. Were the supports for the stadium's fixed concrete roof put together solidly? After all tying the many very heavy precast elements together with high-strength wire under sometimes brutal winter conditions and on an accelerated building schedule was an almost impossible task. Is there any corrosion of the all-important high tension bars that keep the stadium together? (Will we have to take measures similar to those used on the approaches to the Champlain and Mercier bridges and install externally attached reinforcing cables sheathed in plastic pipe to take over where the original cables have left off because of corrosion?)

"How does the province's disaster-relief plan for Cape Breton address the infrastructure damage to culverts and businesses, and what role does the $1,000 deductible play in the financial assistance process for affected homeowners and small businesses?","Residents of rain-weary Cape Breton will have to wait a few more days before the province determines if flooded basements and businesses qualify for financial assistance. Jamie Muir, the minister responsible for emergency measures, took a first-hand look yesterday at some of the areas hardest hit when a month's worth of rain soaked the island last week. After a tour that included collapsed culverts on the outskirts of Sydney, a heavily damaged basement in the town of Dominion, and a swamped store in Glace Bay, the minister said it will take days to place a dollar figure on the damage. ""We've seen damage in all areas,"" said Muir, a Truro resident who experienced the massive flooding that took place there a few years ago. Muir said there was a ""significant amount of damage,"" but didn't speculate on the total cost. ""Each case is different,"" he said. MUST TALLY DAMAGE While the province has a disaster-relief plan, Muir said individual homeowners will have to tally the damage and apply for assistance. The policy, which carries a $1,000 deductible, covers uninsurable damage to homes and small businesses up to $50,000. The overall damage must also trigger a national relief policy before the provincial plan kicks in.","Residents of rain-weary Cape Breton will have to wait a few more days before the province determines if flooded basements and businesses qualify for financial assistance.

The city is offering them a difficult choice: The project will leave them with ditches in front of their houses, where there were none before, or the city will charge them $100 a metre to cover the full cost of installing and covering new culverts along most of their frontage.

"How have insurance payouts related to water damage in Quebec been economically impacted by climate change, as mentioned in the passage, particularly in the context of the specific weather events described?","Doctors are natural allies of environmentalists, but Suzuki recently shared the podium with executives from Petro-Canada, Toyota and other corporations. In a sign of the times, these corporate leaders echoed Suzuki's words. ""The potential risk to our planet is immense,"" said Petro-Canada senior director Greta Raymond in Calgary. ""We can try to resist or delay change, or we can adapt to changing reality and ensure a long-term future for our company."" The risk that Raymond refers to is climate change, which, like air pollution, results largely from burning fossil fuels. Its catastrophic implications are a powerful force behind the greening of business - because when the environment ails, the economy is close behind. The Saguenay floods and the ice storm were Quebecers' harsh initiation into the extreme weather events that climate-change models predict - and their economic fallout. The ice storm claimed at least 30 lives, while total costs reached $3 billion. This April, the driest on record, has seen valuable timberland go up in smoke, while low water levels in the St. Lawrence have meant shipping revenue losses. Climate change poses incalculable risks to our economic health.","While Huntingdon was weathering its storm, the principal director of the Insurance Bureau of Canada was in Quebec City.

"How does the passage describe the economic impact on residents living near the Rivière des Prairies who might experience water damage, considering the limitations of standard residential home insurance policies and the need for additional water-damage riders?","Quebec insurers paid out more than $500 million in water-related claims in 2005-06, said Jack Chadirdjian, director of public affairs for the Quebec branch of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. That amount represents 45 per cent of $1.1 billion in payouts overall, he noted.

'Not just more rain,' he said, 'but more rain compressed into shorter periods of time'—like the 100 millimetres (about four inches) of rain that fell in one hour in Montreal in July 1987. The problem of water damage is particularly acute in the Montreal area, where aging infrastructure can't cope with heavy storms. Residential home insurance policies do not cover water damage as a routine general risk.

What specific actions were civil-protection authorities and Premier Lucien Bouchard urging residents to take in response to the freezing conditions and power outages mentioned in the passage?,"Toronto wasn't the only place hit - police in Peel region, west of Toronto, said witnesses spotted funnel clouds near Oakville and in Brampton. Environment Canada said the damage was caused by a microburst, a downdraft of strong winds from a thunderstorm that can resemble a tornado's spinning funnel of air. Mike Adamson, a weather services specialist, said about 4 millimetres of rain fell in the city's downtown during the brief storm that rumbled east. At least two people were taken to hospital after being hit by lightning, and a Brampton boy was injured when a tree limb fell on him after another lightning strike. Farther west, in Milton, power lines toppled over and hail was reported in the east end of Toronto. The heat wave has prompted authorities to urge Ontario residents to restrict their use of electricity because of the strain on the distribution system. Power outages could occur if electricity use during peak times is not reduced. The new legislation resulted from negotiations between Guarnieri and the Justice Department, as well as intense lobbying by her supporters in caucus and cabinet.","(To be sure, were the situation turned on its head - had a federal Liberal handed out a similar cheque while a Liberal government was in power in Quebec and Mr. Bouchard was in opposition - you can be sure he would be anything but smiling.)

Andrew Perkins, 10, was arrested, slapped into handcuffs and thrown into jail for the night after a waitress saw him kick his mother outside a restaurant during a family squabble. The mother, Arlene Martin, said her son merely brushed her leg. Nonetheless, police said Florida's domestic-violence law obliged the officers to take the action they did rather than, say, give everyone a good talking-to. A spokesman added that for the officers to have failed to act would have left them open to an internal investigation, departmental sanctions and civil liabilities.

The floods have intensified this year in part because many farmers, in their urge to take advantage of economic reforms, have planted crops in flood plains, Chinese officials said this week. These fields have eaten away at the shores and riverbanks. Little effort has been spent recently on flood prevention in some areas. The Chinese state-run media has spent much of the last week reporting on the floods and on the impact that a completed Three Gorges Dam project would have on controlling the Yangtze River. In a recent speech, Lu Youmet, chairman of the Three Gorges Development Corp, said that if the dam had been completed, the problems of flood control would have already been solved.","It's a small firm - just three employees, themselves included - working out of the second-floor office of a nondescript building on Somerled Ave these days while the fate of their original Victoria Ave location gets decided by their former landlord's estate.

A12 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 10, 1998 QUEBEC Disaster money never in doubt Same federal cash program helped victims of Saguenay, Red River floods TERRANCE WILLS Gazette Ottawa Bureau OTTAWA - The same disaster assistance program that provided $100 million in federal aid after the Saguenay floods will be available to Quebecers battered by ice storms, Prime Minister Jean Chretien says. ""When there is a national disaster, there is a formula that applies automatically,"" he said after a cabinet session that was supposed to be devoted to long-term planning but instead was - in the PM's words - ""faced with the emergency in Montreal.""","Duceppe said Masse had offered this 90-10 split with Quebec after the 1996 Saguenay flood - and he had the letter to prove it. The letter was sent by Masse to Brassard, he said. Why is he not prepared to do it this time? Duceppe demanded of Masse. Masse said it was unfortunate Duceppe didn't check further with his source to get Brassard's reply to his offer after the Saguenay flood. Mr. Brassard said it would be unfair under the circumstances to have the 90-10 split along the lines of the Alberta program and he said: I propose we have an ad hoc agreement, which could go up to $50 million financed equally by our two governments and managed by both, Masse said. This 50-50 formula was used for small businesses affected in both the Saguenay and Red River floods, Masse said. EXCELLENT FIRST STEP In Quebec, Michel Audet, president of the Chambre de Commerce du Quebec, said the program is an excellent first step to help small businesses that were immobilized for three weeks and sometimes longer in the so-called triangle of darkness.","While Jonquiere residents began returning to their homes, about 150 residents of the North Shore community of Forestville were evacuated because authorities were concerned that a wooden dam might give way under the continued pressure of tonnes of water pushing up against it, said Lavallee. Throughout the North Shore, Charlevoix and Saguenay-Lac St.-Jean regions, road crews were busy trying to reopen highways closed after sections of roadway or bridges were washed away by the floods. However, it will be days before all the highways are open again. Hydro-Quebec crews were also busy trying to re-establish power to an estimated 8,000 subscribers. Late yesterday, the government's emergency co-ordination centre was one of those customers, with officials briefing reporters by cellular phone. Officials were also busy yesterday setting up a system to distribute the $2,500 advances to flood victims under a program announced by Premier Lucien Bouchard Monday night. Officials said yesterday that the cheques will be available to those who ""are expected to be out of their homes for 14 days or more."" Those eligible have to get forms certified by city officials and take them to their financial institution and get the money."

Those hit by the floods are also expected to get reimbursed for a higher portion of their lost home and furnishings. Small businesses are usually eligible for aid equaling half the cost of replacing equipment and essential inventory, up to $75,000, but that also is expected to be increased this time.

The trial continues today. The company announced in a terse statement that it would shut down operations at the mill as of March 20. It did not say whether the closing would be permanent, and company officials were unavailable for comment. At least 365 mill workers would lose their jobs. More than a thousand other jobs in woodland operations and related businesses could also be wiped out. The New Brunswick government, the city of Bathurst and unions said they were shocked by the company's decision to walk away from the mill after failing to gain concessions from workers. Stone-Consolidated, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based Stone Container Inc., wanted, among other things, a 20-per-cent reduction in wages, including cancellation of a negotiated 5.5-per-cent increase due on June 28. The workers refused.

Rearing himself majestically out of the seething bodies like a mighty column of black rock, he fell backward, tearing himself away from the clinging monster. Up rose his enormous tail from the boiling vortex, and descended like a sleek scythe, literally tearing one of his antagonists beneath it, the sound of the blow reverberating like thunder.

Which areas experienced significant power outages due to the storm's impact on infrastructure as mentioned in the passage?,"But in the end Igor's impact was limited, with little structural damage despite a massive loss of power that affected every corner of the island chain. Power company Belco said 28,700 of its 35,000 customers were without electricity. It was not known how long Bermudans would have to go without power, but past outages from storms have lasted days. The sheer size of the storm, which had a wind field of nearly 600 miles (965 kilometres), meant Bermuda was in for a continued battering even as Igor retreated, with tropical storm strength winds anticipated for much of the day. Premier Ewart Brown sounded the alarm late last week that Igor could prove as devastating as Hurricane Fabian, which claimed four lives and caused millions of dollars of damage in 2003. Those fears proved unfounded, however. The biggest hit, perhaps, was to the tourism industry that drives the economy here. Officials said they suffered a big loss in bookings for the weekend, after an exodus of tourists on Thursday and Friday, although many visitors chose to ride out the storm in their hotels. Despite the relatively soft blow from Igor, there were still plenty of signs that a major storm had blown through.","But in the end Igor's impact was limited, with little structural damage despite a massive loss of power that affected every corner of the island chain.

The latest weather system, which first hit the eastern United States, dumped about 5 centimetres of snow, ice pellets, freezing rain and heavy rains on Fredericton and southern New Brunswick. The combination of wind, rain and ice could cause power lines to freeze and weigh down trees, causing them to fall and take out lines, New Brunswick Power said. ""If the temperature is sitting around zero and it continues to rain, we'll get freezing rain buildup and that will make a mess,"" said spokesman Paul Callaghan. ""We'll have power lines down everywhere."" The forecast called for more heavy rain and temperatures to remain around the freezing mark. Fallen trees knocked out power to about 2,400 homes in the province yesterday. Callaghan said he hoped to have them all back up by last night. Most of the outages were in Fredericton, but hydro crews were also working to repair power lines around St. Andrews in the southern part of the province. There are also concerns the heavy rain will cause major flooding."

However, where the hurricane did hit, the devastation was and still is mind-boggling. A storm like this picks no favorites. It ripped apart ritzy estates in posh suburbs south of Miami with the same intensity that it flattened mobile-home parks, migrant-worker camps and slum housing in communities like Goulds, Florida City and Homestead. Inside the black cloud that was Hurricane Andrew there was a silver lining - in fact, several silver linings. Most of Florida's tourist industry, about 99 per cent of it, dodged a bullet.

He and other native leaders stayed about two hours until Chretien's office promised a reply today to their demand for a meeting with the PM. Throughout the country, aboriginals held rallies and slowed traffic to demand action on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.

About Martintown the stream overflowed its banks, deluging the low flat land for miles round, carrying off sluiceways and bridges, and making travel almost impossible. At Lancaster, not for thirty years has such a flood been known. The sudden thawing of the unusually large quantity of snow caused every creek to overflow its banks.

Rimmer wrote that the James Bay area consisted of wide coastal marshes, tidal flats and numerous shallow bays all of which serve as highly productive food sources for birds.

The critical load is the amount of acid that an area can withstand without damage. In Quebec, hardwood and coniferous stands in areas where critical loads were exceeded had a growth rate 30 per cent lower than in sites without the excessive deposits. The problem is that acid rain is removing essential plant nutrients like calcium from soils via leaching, Heather Morrison, editor of the Environment Canada assessment, said in an interview yesterday. Elements such as calcium and magnesium not only nourish trees but also act as buffers which neutralize acid pollution, she added. The study also notes that acid deposition is growing in western Canada, and emissions in the west are projected to exceed those in the east if current trends continue."

In the Great Whale drainage basin, for example, the vegetation supporting soil is down in the valleys and at the higher elevations it is mostly bare rock. When such valleys are flooded, the displaced animals and insects are left with less and less or no arable soils and in many cases, most cannot survive. Also, beavers who build wintering huts downstream of dams are chased out of them by rising winter water levels, at a time when snow cover precludes the building of new ones, not to mention their lost food reserves. And they die. In the La Grande river system, mercury levels due to decomposing vegetation are still rising after some 13 years (the natives are advised not to eat the fish) but there are signs that the rate of increase is slowing down. But we have no records to help us predict how long it will likely rise, level off, or drop to acceptable levels. Aquatic and land animals all form part of the food chain on which we inevitably depend."
"How has the manipulation of water flow in South Florida's Everglades affected the nesting cycles of wading birds such as wood storks, herons, and ibis, according to the passage?","Birds in the wild: ""Seeing wild flamingos today is much rarer than it was then; you can expect to see some that were bred in captivity but there's no shortage of exotic birds you can see in the wild."" The roseate spoonbill, often mistaken for a flamingo, is one. The rosy-pink birds swing their distinctive spoon-shaped bills back and forth through the bottom mud of Florida Bay until they strike something that could be dinner. You can also see wood ibises, which are really storks, the only storks native to the United States. There are reddish egrets and rare great white herons and Florida has more bald eagles than any other state except Alaska. About 50 pairs of bald eagles nest along the coast in the Everglades. Another intriguing Everglades bird is the anhinga, also known as the snakebird for its long sleek head and neck. The anhinga swims along the surface searching for fish, dives underwater and spears its prey. But then it has to perch itself on a branch in the sun and spread its wings to dry.","levees and canals have segmented the vital sheet flow Sugar cane and tomato farmers now control the water table in large areas of the Everglades, dumping or retaining water according to weather conditions and growing schedules Anytime they want to, they can pump out, and anytime they want they can pump it back in, said Burkett Neely, manager of the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, one of three water conservation areas that serve as a buffer between the cane fields and the park Drought recently prompted neighboring sugar cane growers to pump more water onto their land for irrigation, forcing the water district to draw down the water level in the 58,000-hectare refuge by 7.5 cm I called them on it, and they said it was a drop in the bucket, Neely said Well, it was, but it was a drop that we needed I had birds and ducks change their feeding patterns because of that The disruptions have been especially cruel to the Everglades' famous plumed wading birds, which once gathered here in enormous white clouds and were a major factor in the decision to establish the park in 1947 For example, artificial water fluctuations have forced wood storks to delay nesting until late winter,"," sort of fugitive, Posters or advertisements warned anyone from giving a fugitive apprentice any aid or shelter, In 1808, an advertisement in the Canadian Courant, a Montreal newspaper, announced that a 19-year-old apprentice learning the trade of cabinetmaking had run away in violation of his contract, He was described in detail, like an escaped criminal: 5 feet, 4 inches high, slender shape, pale visage, blue eyes and short brown hair, speaks English and French, His dress when last seen was described: a white cotton shirt, a short blue coat and grey corduroy overalls, with a pair of half-boots, a red cotton neck handkerchief, spotted white, He had been seen crossing the river to Longueuil, Whoever brought this runaway back to his master would receive a reward of $20 (a considerable sum at the time), But anyone harboring him would be prosecuted, Such advertisements were frequent, And the rigor of the law was always threatened."

It's a rate much higher than the region can support, said Robert Jefferies, a plant biologist at the University of Toronto. A committee of scientists and other parties, including the Manitoba Department of Natural Resources, is trying to figure out how to curb that growth. The committee is considering legalizing spring hunting of snow geese and raising the bag limit on geese that can be shot during the hunting season. I think there will be profound changes in the ecosystem if this continues unchecked, Jefferies said. Once you've endangered these fragile sub-arctic ecosystems, it takes a long time for them to bounce back even in the absence of geese. Since the snow geese population study began in 1968, more than 300 biologists and other researchers have been involved in genetic and evolutionary research. Their work has generated more than 100 scientific papers. Since 1978, Jefferies has spent every summer working out of the non-profit Churchill Northern Studies Centre in his ongoing examination into the effects of snow geese on their natural breeding habitat.","Yet Baskatong Reservoir might well become a prime walleye fishing destination again before the turn of the century, thanks to the Association des Pourvoyeurs du Baskatong. This past summer, the organization of outfitters operating around the reservoir released 1.1 million walleye fingerlings in Baskatong and a handful of surrounding lakes. And early next summer, the organization hopes to release a whole lot more - 3 million, give or take a few. The restocking operation is unique in that it was actually carried out by the outfitters using government facilities and expertise, marking a new trend in resource management at a time when the government itself is withdrawing from such activities in response to budgetary restrictions. Primary funding for the project comes from the Baskatong outfitters' association itself; the provincial fish and game department provided equipment and expertise, and Hydro-Quebec, the utility company which caused the decline in walleye numbers to begin with, provided a paltry $10,000 to be split between '94 and '95 stocking operations. As an aside to the walleye stocking operations, the outfitters' association also released some 1,000 landlocked salmon in Baskatong Reservoir."

Since 1968, Quebec's population of these secretive birds has been in a decline. Not much of a decline-only about 1.8 per cent per year - but a decline nonetheless. And when you take the accumulated impact of about a quarter century of a barely noticeable decline, you end up with a total loss of 39 per cent of the population in relation to what existed in the late 1960s. If it continues, the population will have been halved in another decade. In large part, the decline can be blamed directly on habitat loss. Urban sprawl and the determination to turn every bit of vacant scrub land into suburban housing developments and shopping malls has deprived the birds of much of their vital breeding habitat and feeding grounds. Ideal habitat to woodcock looks like worthless land to humans and we have an obsession about not leaving land idle. But we're not entirely at fault."

What specific human health impact is highlighted in the passage as a result of the intense heatwaves in California?,"Lefebvre, a toxicologist who acted as a resource person at the environmental hearings, says his department will now look at whether it's feasible to isolate various factors that affect the health of the east-end population. He must ascertain whether the population is large enough to draw conclusions about the effects of atmospheric pollution, once people affected by other health issues, such as smoking, are discounted. CLSCs serving a few other sectors of the island show consistently higher rates of certain health problems than those in Montreal's east end. CLSCs in St. Henri, downtown (Des Faubourgs), Point St. Charles, Cote des Neiges and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve generally report more problems than those in Montreal's east end, even though there are fewer heavily polluting factories in these sectors, Lefebvre noted. AIR QUALITY ""Health is not only linked to environmental pollution; there is a whole panoply of other factors that need to be ruled out before we can draw conclusions,"" he said. He notes that studies have already shown that socio-economic factors have an impact on health. Welfare recipients show higher incidence of asthma than wealthier people, for example, but it is not clear whether poorer neighborhoods generally have worse air quality.","Become a Gazette 7-day subscriber to be eligible for these prizes. 1st prize 12 months mortgage-free 2nd prize 6 months mortgage-free 3rd prize 3 months mortgage-free I Send to: The Gazette Mortgage Free Contest P0 Box 11062, Suite 100, Centre-Ville, Montreal, Que H3C 4Z9 I Name Address City Prov THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1998 WEG13 WEST END SAFETY NOW Learning how to beat the heat FRANCOIS SENECAL-TREMBLAY JR Special to the Gazette The Canadian Forces stationed in Valcartier invited me to participate in a 1,500-kilometre, 24-hour-a-day, five-day relay race.

The risk of developing a heat illness increases if one exercises or has inadequate water intake. The very young, whose sweat glands are not fully developed, and the elderly are most at risk. Individuals who have consumed alcohol (a diuretic) or drugs with similar effects should be particularly vigilant. There are two types of heat illness: heat exhaustion and heatstroke.

"What are the estimated economic impacts of the snowstorm on roofs, food spoilage at commercial establishments, and potential insurance claims according to Medza's observations?","As much as $91 billion a year a groundbreaking federal study says. The research paper pegs the price of Canada's 1994 jobless rate of 10.4 per cent at $29 billion to $77 billion in lost productivity and another $14 billion in health crime and other social costs. The figures indicate Canada with an unemployment rate stuck at around 10 per cent this year once again stands to lose tens of billions of dollars to joblessness. The Human Resources Department study takes a rare look beyond the direct productivity costs of unemployment to measure the toll on physical and mental health marriages and communities. ""We have to take account of those costs when we are talking about unemployment,"" said study author Marcel. Bedard, a researcher with the federal department, reviewed existing research and discovered, if not a certain link, strong indications that unemployment can cause higher levels of illness, premature death and crime. Experts agree on the reasons: Malnutrition among the poor, resulting in chronic disease. Generally higher stress levels in low-income groups, associated with mental disorders, alcoholism, suicide, accidents, heart disease and other illnesses due to high blood pressure. The unemployed are not the only ones to suffer the consequences of these problems, says Bedard's study, completed in June.","The first thing you should do is take steps to minimize the damage. If part of your roof has been ripped away, try to cover the hole so that the problem isn't made worse, Medza said. Next, make a list of damages and losses and then call your insurance company or broker and wait for the claims adjuster. Making claims for spoiled food may not be so easy. Some insurance companies have instituted deductibles that range from $200 to $500 for food spoilage. The policy was put in place after last year's ice storm, when the insurance industry paid out millions of dollars to households that lost the contents of their refrigerators and freezers. It's next to impossible to keep track of who does charge a deductible and who doesn't, said John Turley, a broker with Burton and Turley, insurance brokers. If you're lucky, your policy still covers food spoilage. A spokesman for Axa Assurance Inc, one of Quebec's largest insurance companies, said the volume of calls hasn't been heavy yet, but the company is braced for increased volume as more people regain power. Wide areas of the Eastern Townships are still without electricity.","They go hand-in-hand with summer heat and humidity.

"What specific infrastructure and ecological impacts have been observed in the areas mentioned, such as the conditions at Wildwood, Anglesea, and Sandy Hook, as described in the passage?","MARK STEIN LOS ANGELES TIMES Logging has created forest islands that can decimate sensitive plant and animal species. LOS ANGELES - Careful analysis of satellite images indicates the Amazon rain forest is being deforested at a ""considerably lower"" rate than recently estimated, but the impact on biological diversity may be greater than feared, University of New Hampshire and NASA scientists report. That apparent paradox is due to the pattern of forest loss, the scientists reported yesterday in the journal Science. Forests in the Amazon region of Brazil are felled in irregular patches that create ""islands"" of trees too small to support plants and animals normally found there. Besides stripping trees from 15,000 square kilometers of forest annually, logging often fragments habitats and upsets the balance of predator and prey. It also exposes the edges of these forest islands to climate changes, foraging livestock, humans and other influences that can decimate sensitive plant and animal species. This ""edge effect,"" which the scientists blame for most of the damage in the Amazon, also has been seen near clearcut logging operations in the Pacific Northwest.","Experts warn that environmental problems in protected wilderness areas will worsen until Parks Canada makes ecological integrity its prime mandate - ahead of tourism.

There is little to record in the grain situation except that matters remain in the same complicated state and dealers are positive in their statements that unless they can arrange to ship via New York they cannot do business, and many of them have given orders to their agents in the country not to buy.","Nevertheless, the artist has admirably succeeded in giving the principal outlines of the city, and characteristics of its buildings, grouping, as well as the surrounding country. The Cyclorama should be seen by everyone, especially all Sunday-school children and their teachers, as well as all the clergy, ministers and priests of every denomination, for it is a work of art, fascinating by its incidents and elevating and ennobling by its spirit, being a gospel in itself. I therefore heartily recommend the Christian public at large to go and see it, for no one could spend a more profitable half hour in a better place calculated to be of value towards the development of the moral and spiritual character.

Early on Saturday morning the people of the village got news from people above the river that the ice was coming down in great quantities and was flooding a large extent of land. At 4 o'clock p.m. the floods struck the lower part of the village, above the iron bridge, and destroyed everything it met, houses, sheds, stables, etc. The ice bridge near the iron bridge, which was as solid as during the winter season, held good, saving the two spool wood factories and a great number of houses below the iron bridge from destruction. The river took its regular course about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, causing no additional damage. The houses and other buildings completely destroyed are: Mrs. S. U. Bergeron, Jos. Gagnon, Dr. Boulanger, H. Villeneuve, Alexis Tremblay, Jos. Turotte and John Y. Lajoie. Great damage was experienced by about twelve other parties.","GRACE CHURCH Among the heavy losers by the flood is Grace Church, Episcopal. This is a very pretty little church situated on Wellington Street. During the flood, the water was four or five feet deep in the edifice, and as the water came so quickly, it was impossible to save anything. The total loss cannot be less than $1,500. The organ, which is one of Warren's best, is badly damaged. It will be some time before service can be held, as the floor and foundation will have to be repaired, it having fallen over a foot in some places.

The largest halibut in the lot weighs one hundred and seventy-five pounds and measured 6 feet 4 inches in length. This result of the fishing of a small party for so short a time must open the eyes of our Atlantic fishermen and there seems to be no doubt that the most abundant results may be expected from the exploration of our fisheries on the Pacific coast. It is probable that those fisheries may not prove even second to our wonderful mineral deposits in their value to the country. The Work of the Blizzard.

A record-breaking November blizzard swept over the greater portion of New England last night and today, completely demoralizing traffic of every description and well nigh paralysing telegraphic and telephonic communication, while the northeast gale, coming on a high course of tides, drove the sea far beyond its usual limits and made a mark along shore only exceeded by the memorable hurricane of 1801. The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly.","Temperature at morning was zero.

For about 500 miles north of the international boundary line along the Peace River to the Great Slave Lake, the land for the most part is rich and fertile, and on account of the warm southwest winds which sweep along the slopes and through the passes of the Rocky Mountains, the climate is temperate for a great part of the year. In many districts round the Hudson's Bay posts and the missionary stations there are the nuclei of settlements, and in connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway, now in course of construction, the entire country has been thoroughly explored by scientific men and practical agriculturists, who have ascertained beyond doubt that it contains fine pasturage and at least two hundred million acres of the finest wheat land in the world.

Last year was the warmest in Britain since weather records started in 1659. It was also the sunniest year since 1909 and the driest since 1976. John Houghton, director of the Meteorological Institute, said experts believe that the warmer temperatures can now be linked to the global warming, or greenhouse effect. The year 1989 was also the second warmest on record in New Zealand, as well as being the warmest there since 1971. Government meteorologists said that the unusual warmth was caused by the atmospheric phenomenon La Nina. It occurs between episodes of the more publicized El Nino which brings cold weather to New Zealand.

Of the total 1,577,097 went to France, from which country, however, we received 16,452.

We are driven to the conclusion that, on the whole, the good prevails over the evil, and that a tolerably fair tide of prosperity has been experienced during the past year, and that the members of the Chamber of Commerce have had their share of the general success, though they are too modest to say so. Indeed, the single fact stated in the report that the quantity of dried codfish exported from Newfoundland and Labrador, between January and December of 1880 amounted to 1,422,875 quintals, ought to silence all grumbling and produce a buoyant account of our affairs. The returns for the year ending August, 1881, are not yet complete, but the report states that the foregoing figures will be exceeded when these returns are received. Thus, then, the export of our grand staple for the past year has been one of the largest on record."

The long drought of summer left pastures in a rather bare condition, but fall rains revived them to a wonderful extent and livestock in general had a splendid chance to pull up. The supply of cattle was greater than the demand, and although few fat stock were offering, they were in good general condition. Sheep also were in a healthy and vigorous state, but the demand for lambs was light, except at such low prices that few holders cared to sell. An immense number of hogs were sold, correspondents writing that they were being disposed of chiefly on foot. No mention was made of disease among livestock, and, but for the low markets, the season would be counted as a successful one. Dairying is more than holding its own. While there was a great falling off in the milk flow in several counties in question, Ontario, owing to the mid-summer drought, the returns from that part of the province are still encouraging, while the reports from the dairy counties along the St. Lawrence were even more satisfactory."
What specific factors contributed to the wheat crop in Manitoba being in the most flourishing condition despite the drought and excessive heat reported in the passage?,Receipts posted on Change today were: G,"Cameron, the big push letters, the persuasions of Hon. John Simpson, Simpson, the raspberry vinegar employed in Lincoln, and dozens of other instances of widespread bribery make the language of the Times ridiculous. Reports received by the Manitoba Department of Agriculture show that farmers are beginning to turn their attention to cattle raising in a very marked degree and the numbers will be greatly increased from year to year. From all that can be gathered a great many calves are being reared this season by all who can at all do so. Dairy farming is carried on as largely as the means of farmers will permit. All the butter that can be made is made and the supply is largely in excess of the consumption in the great majority of townships. It is doubtful, the report says, if any other part of the Dominion is more favorable for dairy farming than this country. In some of the older provinces the making season for butter and cheese may be longer, but then drought frequently prevails, and the partial failure of the pastures results in a corresponding failure of the supply of milk. In Manitoba, on the other hand, dried up pastures are the exception, the grass possesses the most nourishing qualities, and the rainfall is generally abundant and very evenly distributed.","The storm over eastern Canada last night has passed off the coast and across Newfoundland It has caused high winds and light local snow falls in Eastern Canada The area of high pressure from the Northwest is passing rapidly southeastward, and is being followed by lower pressure over the Northwest and Upper Lakes Minimum and maximum temperatures: Calgary, 10, 18; Esquimalt, 40, 41; Battleford, 10 below, 18; Qu'Appelle, 4 below, 18; Winnipeg, 12 below, 8; Port Arthur, 10 below, 24; Toronto, 10, 21; Kingston, 2, 14; Montreal, 4, 10; Quebec, 2, 10; Halifax, 32, 32 MANITOBA CROP The last official bulletin for 1893, dealing with crops, live stock, etc., for Manitoba, was published this week, from information received up to December 1 The report states as follows: A glance at this report shows that the Red River valley has been the most favored district this year, and that the southwestern and western parts of the province have suffered from the hot winds and the want of rain Since the August bulletin was issued several unusual climatic changes"
"How has the long drought affected the agricultural output of oats and hay compared to peas and roots in Ontario, and what implications does this have for farmers in the region?","Number increasing. Other towns ask help. Adana is the center of Cilician plain, ordinarily so fertile, but this year is absolutely barren on account of drought. THE CROP PROSPECT The drought that has been a marked feature of the summer almost all over the northern part of the continent has had a visible effect on all kinds of growing crops, and it is now evident that the harvest in Canada will not be so abundant as the early season gave promise of. Almost all the provinces have been affected in greater or less degree, Nova Scotia suffering most perhaps and Quebec least. Here the season is later than in the West, and the conditions that have prevailed generally have not had the same influence for evil as in other districts. There is an apparent difference too between areas in comparatively close proximity, which indicates that showers that have fallen have often been local in their influence. So far as advices have been received, and they cover the western and southern districts fairly, the hay crop has been a large one and has been saved in good order. Grain is doing well, especially in the Ottawa counties, where wheat and oats are likely to be above the average, and potatoes the same. Throughout the Townships an average yield is generally looked for.","Almost all the provinces have been affected in greater or less degree, Nova Scotia suffering most perhaps and Quebec least.

Throughout the Townships an average yield is generally looked for. Rain has fallen copiously within two weeks and the pastures have greatly benefited. This has had its effect upon the cattle, and as a consequence the supply of milk at the cheese factories has kept well up. With cheese at its present price this means a large addition to the farmers' income that will, if the markets are maintained, more than recoup them for the decline that has been experienced in the export cattle trade.","Brampton, Ont, July 9, Crops will be light. Hay will not average a half crop. The rains of the last few days came just in time to save the potato crop. It will also add fifteen percent to the spring grain. JexBbinfiB, Ont, July 9, Crops on the whole are a fair average and much less injured from the drought than would be expected. Fall grain is excellent, but spring crops are short in straw, though fine color and heading well. Peas are variable, alfalfa is very short in straw and hard to harvest, but has a good yield of seed. Hay is exceedingly light. Potatoes look well. Fruit is generally scarce, having been injured by spring frost. Lindsay, Ont, July 9, The crops in this vicinity have suffered severely during the past month, more especially where the land is sandy soil. The barley crop is almost a failure. Roots will not be so good as was expected, owing to the dry weather. Barley, oats, wheat and peas have suffered, but it is thought most of the grain crops will recover if we have some more rain. The cool nights have probably saved a good deal of grain from destruction."
"What specific actions has Helgeson, the state commissioner of agriculture, taken to address the unprecedented suffering due to drought in the newer portion of the state, and what assistance is being sought for the provisions, clothing, fuel, and feed for stock in these counties?","But the devastated district in North Dakota is directly dependent upon the Twin Cities, Duluth, and the larger towns on the line of the Northern Pacific Railroad in Dakota for assistance. Grand Forks has already appointed committees and is actively engaged in supplying clothing and some provisions to the North Dakota district. An Appeal for Assistance. The committee of the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce has decided to correspond with the Mayor of Fargo, Jamestown, Bismarck, and other Dakota cities, and ascertain whether any organized movements have been made toward relieving these people, and also to communicate with the state authorities of North Dakota to ascertain if there are any funds available which may be used for this purpose and what action will be taken by the State officers in this matter. It is imperative that the devastated district of North Dakota should receive some assistance immediately. The supplies most urgently required are boots, shoes, hosiery, mittens, undergarments, flour, corn meal, necessary groceries, and grain for their stock. Arrangements have been made for the free transportation of products intended for distribution among the people. On the Verge of Starvation. Two years ago the farmers of Marshall County, Minn., were unfortunate enough to lose almost their entire crops.","""How has this affected our area?"" Ed Fetting, an economic development officer in Lethbridge, Alta., said, before the committee in February. ""Currently, there is not an industry in our community that has not been affected by this, outside of the public sector."" ""Lumberyards, truck sales, electricians, plumbers, bulk fuel sales, veterinarian services, even down to the accountants and lawyers, have all been affected,"" Fetting added. ""An acquaintance within the accounting industry referred to the situation in our area as a meltdown."" The mad cow crisis arrived on the heels of years of drought and grasshopper infestations, other witnesses told the committee, and the weakened farm sector forced municipalities across the Prairies to make adjustments that could have far-reaching implications on the daily lives of residents. ""We have municipalities forgiving taxes, getting rid of late payment fees and lowering mill rates,"" Jack Hayden, president of the Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties, told the committee last month.","""Seasonal temperatures in Florida have hit freezing before, but it's unusual for cold spells to last this long,"" said McElroy. Relatively frigid temperatures are expected to last until the weekend. And while it's not yet clear whether crops will be permanently damaged during this days-long Florida freeze, the effect is already being felt among Canadian importers. ""It's driving up the prices. There's less product available out of Florida, so it's creating demand for other areas,"" such as Mexico, said Mike Pitsikoulis, co-owner of Montreal-based Canadawide Fruit Wholesalers, which also ships throughout Quebec and parts of Ontario. He said a bushel of green peppers has nearly doubled in price since last week, to $14 from $8. ""They were in a panic mode a little bit, down in Florida. There's no product to load,"" said Pitsikoulis, who added that chilly temperatures in Texas are also affecting such produce as greens. His company ships to hotels, chain stores Loblaws and Metro, and smaller supermarkets and stores. Pitsikoulis said most farmers have a limited supply of harvested crops in coolers."

In the eastern counties, along the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, the wet season continued down to the middle of August, and the rot is reported to have done serious damage to the crop.

PASTURES AND FALL HEADING The drought which has prevailed over the western part of the province for six weeks, and over the whole province for a month, has left pastures very brown and bare, and livestock have fallen off in flesh. The milk supply has also been affected, and the dairy industry is suffering. But the most serious effect of the drought this month is seen in the delay it has caused to seeding operations.

Varied Accounts as to the Prospects of the Crop in the Province of Quebec. TORONTO, July 30 (Special)—A small bunch of blackened wheat was on exhibition at the Board of Trade today. It was out of St. Catharines, and after standing in a field for a few days began to sprout. This is one of the effects of the recent heavy rain. A well-known grain dealer has been gathering information as to the grain crop in the immediate vicinity of Toronto. The result is that he comes to the conclusion that a majority of the fields of wheat have sprouted and the effects will be very bad. If this had kept on another week, said he, ""we could have had the best crop of wheat in years."" It is generally believed by grain men that the damage to grain in Ontario by the rain will have serious effects on the crop. Welland, Ont., July 30. Crops along the Niagara frontier have been badly injured by the heavy rains."
"How has the drought in England specifically affected the wheat crop compared to other countries, and what impact does this have on the prospects of wheat trade advancement according to the passage?","The sales of wheat at New York for export yesterday were 134,000 bushels. The Victorian wheat crop has turned out poorly in regard to quality. The average weight is reported at 58.3 lbs, against 63 lbs last year. The latest news from the Argentine Republic confirms the report regarding the yield of the wheat crop this year, and the general impression is that 31,000,000 bushels will be the outside figure for the outturn. The Liverpool Corn Trade news says that complaints of crop damage in France are not as loud as they were some time ago. Some fields were injured, and the late districts would soon show the effect. Some of the recent press dispatches from the Northwest state that the farmers will put in a large acreage of oats and corn, and a reduced acreage of wheat. A letter from Topeka to the Northwestern Miller says that the recent rains throughout Kansas and the adjacent territory were very beneficial and with no more drawbacks without doubt a good crop would be harvested. Dornbusch says that the farm work is exceedingly belated in the United Kingdom. In France there has not been enough growing weather to determine what damage may have occurred. In Germany complaints are received from some districts.","Liverpool California wheat strong, 7s 11d August, 7s 11 54d September, 8s October and November. Liverpool mixed maize strong, 4s 8 54d August and September, 4s 9 3d October, 4s 10d November. Antwerp spot wheat No. 1 California turn dearer, 8,176. Antwerp spot wheat, No. 8 red winter, turn dearer, 8,102 4. Reports from Europe say that in France, the heavy rain which has prevailed to a more or less extent during the past two months, has been fraught with disastrous consequences to the cereal crops, and very great uneasiness prevails among the farmers. Wheat, in some departments, is said to be ""laid"" as flat as if it had been cut with a sickle, and numerous fields are attacked with rust. The yield of wheat is estimated to be 80,000,000 qrs, which is below the average, and the natural weight of the grain will be from 6 to 10 percent less than last season.","This was dispelled, however, by the appearance of favorable weather, and all the indications now are that Great Britain will have an average yield of grain, and particularly of wheat. That is, the average yield per acre of wheat will be fully abreast of former years, but whether the aggregate yield will be equal to former years must depend upon whether there has been a material decrease in the aggregate acreage. Mr. James Caird, who is head of the tithe system of Great Britain, and to whom all crop reports are made, informed me that the crops of Europe would be very good this year. Of the crop in Great Britain, he spoke quite confidently, although he was unable to say then whether the acreage was equal to former years. The indications for good crops in France are abundantly satisfactory, and the grain is now so far advanced that no serious damage can occur from the weather, which is just now very favorable. France will not, however, have sufficient wheat to meet her own demands, but will not, of course, require as much as last year, when her grain crop suffered from the disaster which was shared by all European countries."

Intelligence from the cattle regions of this state is of the gloomiest and most depressing character. The loss in cattle will be great. In the southwest and west, cattle are drifting against the fences and are rapidly perishing from cold.","Therefore, a rolling country with abundance of water and fair grazing is better than a superabundance of grass and scarcity of water. Cattle do better in winter when there is some snow on the ground, especially if it is cold enough to freeze the streams or springs, as they are thus in a measure, independent of water. A medium sized herd, say, of 10,000 head, is necessary to make it profitable. The only source of income is from the sale of steers and fat cows, the draft of which from a small herd will not more than meet expenses. The increase of a mixed herd is usually about 25 per cent of the entire herd or about 60 to 66 per cent of the cows over three years old. The winter losses may, according to management and seasons, be from 6 to 30 per cent. Winter feeding cannot be practiced except for full calves, weak cows, thoroughbred bulls, and weaklings of the herd whoever tries to feed the herd fails as surely as does the manager who neglects to feed the latter. Feeding corrals and wintering enclosures of large area are indispensable."

Few mills or factories using large power can afford to be idle during winter, and if they cannot have water they must have steam, which, in this case, would mean steam power four or five months of the year, with water wheels and flumes of unusually large size, in order to utilize a very low waterfall for the remaining months.""","The great height of the bridge and embankment, and the position of the shore ends, would, he thinks, always be felt as disadvantageous in so important a thoroughfare.

THE WATER CONSUMPTION In reference to the particulars concerning the alarming waste of water, published in the Gazette on Monday last, Mr. Lesage, Superintendent of Water Works, further stated in conversation with our reporter yesterday that the consumption of water is still further decreased, being now only from nine to nine and a quarter million gallons a day, fully two-thirds of which he believes to be wasteful, as tests were made at midnight and early in the morning when no one is supposed to be using the water, and the consumption during those hours was shown to be at the rate of six million gallons per day. The test is made by filling the reservoir and stopping the pumping machinery. After a few minutes he measures how much the water has fallen and thus calculates the rate per day."

The tenant, however, immediately over Lalonde, where the ice came from had no written lease, and had not assumed any obligation as to the care of the roof beyond that imposed by law. The municipal bylaws impose upon tenants the obligation of keeping the roof free from snow. By-Law No. 47, sec. 20. This, however, does not change the general responsibility of either owners or tenants to neighbors or persons passing injured by the fall of the building on any part of it or of ice or snow from it. Its only effect could be to render such occupants liable to the penalty enacted for failure to conform to the by-law.

The research paper pegs the price of Canada's 1994 jobless rate of 10.4 per cent at $29 billion to $77 billion in lost productivity and another $14 billion in health crime and other social costs. The figures indicate Canada with an unemployment rate stuck at around 10 per cent this year once again stands to lose tens of billions of dollars to joblessness.

Generally higher stress levels in low-income groups, associated with mental disorders, alcoholism, suicide, accidents, heart disease and other illnesses due to high blood pressure.

In the spring, fresh water mixes with the salt water, pulling up nutrients from the bay's bottom and triggering a bloom of plankton, the minute plants and animals at the bottom of the food chain. But when fresh water cascades out in the winter instead of the spring, scientists believe the plankton bloom is curtailed, reducing the food available up the food chain all the way to the thousands of Cree and Inuit who hunt and fish in the area.

The ice bridge costs $4 per one-way trip, but many hundreds of people use it to shave 30 km off a trip to the Laurentians and countless minutes off their commute when the highways are jammed like they were last Tuesday and Thursday because of accidents on Highway 40. The ice pathway is lined with Christmas trees and Leger said that most people observe the limits and stay within the boundaries. Some (drivers) just have to get off-road, but as long as they stay fairly close (to the roadway) it's usually OK, Leger said. But if they stray 4 miles off the road, then there's trouble, because there are places where the water never freezes. And every year, there are reports of snowmobilers, fishermen and women, children playing on the ice and cars that break through the ice. Last winter a Roxboro man pulled a local boy out of the frigid waters of Rivieres des Prairies after the child had ventured out too far.

"How does the earlier-than-usual ice breakup on the St. Lawrence River, caused by mild weather, specifically impact human safety as illustrated by the couple's experience on the ice?","""We're in a state of emergency,"" said Laval civil protection worker Jean DeMontigny. The river overflowed yesterday in the districts of Laval des Rapides, Ste. Dorothee and St. Francois, putting emergency workers on high alert and forcing the evacuation of at least one household, DeMontigny said. Homeowners were taking few chances. Seven in Pierrefonds-Senneville, including Meunier, had already requested sandbags be put against their windows and doors. Others, their backyards, patio sets and bushes encased in ice, hammered plywood over basement windows. The problem, civil protection workers said yesterday, is the water is turning to slush, impeding the river's flow and causing water levels to rise. ""Normally it's blocks of ice that cause backups in the river,"" said Julie Anne Buckland, a spokesperson for Laval's community services. ""Then we can use dynamite or boats to break it up."" This season, a warm fall kept an ice layer from forming on the surface, and when the sudden cold snap hit, slush formed instead, Buckland said. Some residents, however, dispute that view."," were swept out into the lake by the wind,"" Barsalou said The couple were floating on a chunk of ice that was about the size of a large house, he said Their companions, on ice still attached to the shore, called 911 Barsalou sent out two teams of firefighters in rowboats They fought winds that gusted up to 80 kilometres an hour (Environment Canada issued a high-wind warning yesterday) ""I also asked the Surete du Quebec to dispatch a helicopter from Trois-Rivieres as well as the Coast Guard to fly from the Canadian Forces base in Trenton (Ont.)""","said Andre Barsalou, chief of operations for Division 12 of the Montreal fire department ""The ice broke and one couple got separated from the other and were swept out into the lake by the wind,"" Barsalou said The couple were floating on a chunk of ice that was about the size of a large house, he said Their companions, on ice still attached to the shore, called 911 Barsalou sent out two teams of firefighters in rowboats They fought winds that gusted up to 80 kilometres an hour (Environment Canada issued a high-wind warning yesterday) ""I also asked the Surete du Quebec to dispatch a helicopter from Trois-Rivieres as well as the Coast Guard to fly from the Canadian Forces base in Trenton (Ont.)"" he said Once rescued, the woman was ""shook up"" but her male companion was very calm, Barsalou said About a half-hour after the rescue, all the ice broke away from the shore and drifted out into the St."

How did the Canadian military's response during the ice storm highlight the fragility of modern infrastructure and the importance of trained emergency professionals in comparison to the situation in New Orleans?,"Was there an effective contingency plan for a massive evacuation of Montreal Island municipalities? Hydro-Quebec has never drawn up any sort of contingency plan for working closely with municipalities, even though 80 per cent of Quebecers are dependent on hydroelectric power for heating. Hydro-Quebec does not even have a computer simulation on how to respond to a major power failure like this one. Experts do not doubt that better advance planning and coordination would have lessened the difficulties of coping with the worst recorded ice storm to hit Quebec. While Quebec's civil-protection service moved quickly in the first days to set up shelters, the absence of coordinated emergency plans inevitably led to a slowdown in its ability to respond to citizens' needs. The mayor of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu had to launch a public SOS for generators, beds and blankets for its overcrowded shelter. Good Samaritans raced out to Saint-Jean, laden with blankets, cots and firewood, only to clog up the roads and overwhelm the volunteers at the shelter. Coverage of the shelter's miseries seems to have convinced many more citizens to stay in homes that were dangerously cold rather than seek help in what was beginning to look like a Third World refugee camp.","So it's a pretty unusual state."" Opposition City Councillor Marvin Rotrand, who represents Snowdon, blames the city for not clearing the snow before the ice storm. ""The Bourque administration is planning to make it law for towns to have emergency procedures."" Mario Laframboise, president of the Union des Municipalites du Quebec, the province's largest municipal lobby, said municipalities do need to adopt working emergency plans, but the Quebec government has to outline its responsibilities, too. The entire disaster-response regime needs an in-depth study, he said, because while towns can deal with simple emergencies, they need provincial government support to deal with a widespread catastrophe. Jacinthe Simard, president of the Union des Municipalites Regionales de Comte du Quebec, said the government will have to be careful not to leave municipalities open to lawsuits if they cannot carry out everything that is called for by emergency plans. Belanger said he wants to see hundreds of civil servants trained as auxiliary civil security officials who would be deployed during emergencies, likening them to a militia that would be used as the link between municipalities and the civil security headquarters."," hip club portrays the Montreal jazz scene from 1929 to 1970 (1:45) 72903994 3:30 SE La tête dans les nuages ('93, Lomeoiej Jason London 2382913 Voir dimanche, 8:15 AM 4 PM SHM Samurai Cowboy ('93, Lomeay) Hiromigo Go A Japanese executive moves to Montana to fulfill his lifelong dream of being a cowboy (2:00) 354159 bkid To Be Announced (2:00) 9659517 4:05 EHS Diggstown ('92, Action) James Woods, a boxer and two con artists make a bet with small-town"

In January last, for the first time since 1740 people crossed the Zuider Zee on ice; the Thames, the Rhine and the Elbe were frozen over, and ice formed in the harbor of Toulon on the Mediterranean. People were frozen to death in London, Paris and Perpignan, and even at Naples some perished from the cold. This year January appears to be repeating the story of its 1891 achievements.","Page il IN THEIR OPINION Here's what some of today's Gazette columnists have to say: Looking for Raelian tales of Eve, the Clonehead baby, in the supermarket tabloids?

Six specialists, armed with protective suits, masks and jugs of bleach, inspected the Wadi Al Arab, an Egyptian vessel anchored about 10 kilometres offshore. They completed their search in the afternoon after taking swab samples from the 225-metre-long ship's cabins, living quarters, galley and bridge to determine if the vessel is contaminated with the lethal bacterial disease.

"How did the measures taken to prevent flooding in Riviere des Prairies differ from the situation in Becancour, and what were the specific ecological impacts in each area as described in the passage?","In his report on the ""St. Lawrence bridge and manufacturing scheme,"" engineered by Mr. Shearer, Mr. Kennedy says: ""In investigating the practical consequences of ice jams, as distinct from their causes, it appears at once that it is only the floods which accompany the jams that are of Burtons importance; the movements of the ice itself, for the most part, occur within well-known limits and are easily guarded against, but the floods extend over great and indefinite areas and work serious damage."" Speaking of the flood of April, 1815, he says, the water ""rose until at McGill Street it stood 25 ft. 2 in. above low water, flooding the low parts of the city, causing great suffering and damage. A considerable part of Longueuil, St. Lambert and Laprairie villages and a large area of country on that side of the river and along the Lower Lachine road on the other side were also submerged,"" and in ""April, 1888, a flood occurred from a jam somewhere in the neighborhood of the Victoria bridge,"" overflowing more than half the ground from Point St. Charles to half a mile above the St. Pierre road.","THE PREVENTION OF FLOODS: TO THE EDITOR OF THE GAZETTE Sir, You called attention in a recent issue to the disastrous results of the overflow of the river, and raised the question as to the best means of avoiding their recurrence. It is obvious that the waterway between Commissioners Wharf and the opposite shore is considerably less than the outlet from Laprairie Bay, and probably this reduction in width is something like 600 yards; it is also admitted that the floods are due to the ice jam in the narrows stemming back the current till the pent-up waters overflow their banks. Taking the ice jam as inevitable at this point, the real object is to secure a free passage for the water under the ice, and this could probably be best achieved by dredging out a deep channel on the east side of St. Helen's Island, tapping the deep current that strikes from the bridge to Commissioners Wharf (or leading direct from the bay) and entering St. Mary's current at a convenient point below Isle Ronde. This channel should be nearly the full depth of the current, and of width sufficient to give a sectional area equivalent to the present disparity between the outflow from Laprairie Bay and the narrows.","It is the opinion of the committee that it would serve the following ends: it would protect the new projected wharves and piers and the entrance to the Lachine Canal against ice-shoves in the winter, though the open space left at its lower end may still be too wide to ensure entire protection at and about the entrance; it would create a still-water basin around the new wharves at the entrance to the canal and at Windmill Point, which would immensely increase the facility for moving craft in the neighborhood, and the entrance and dispatch of craft navigating the canal, and generally be an advantage in the meeting of inland and ocean craft, and it would afford another valuable railway connection with ocean vessels. This scheme has been objected to on grounds that the ""guard pier"" would increase floods at and opposite Montreal more frequently than at present, but no reasons have been given in support of such an objection. As previously stated, this was considered and approved by the Flood Commission, who, fresh from an inquiry and investigation of over two years, judge and decide on the guard pier and its effects at and opposite Montreal."

North Pacific Fishery Management Council - to ban Arctic fishing at least until researchers can fully assess the impact of climate change and the retreat of sea ice on fish populations widely believed to be moving northward - was hailed by environmentalists as a prudent and active response to the potential bonanza for northern fishing fleets. ""The environment in the Alaskan Arctic is changing, with warming trends in ocean temperatures and changes in seasonal sea ice conditions potentially favoring the development of commercial fisheries,"" the council concluded. But it argued the U.S. government should ""close the Arctic to commercial fishing so that unregulated fishing does not occur until information improves so fishing can be conducted sustainably and with due concern to other ecosystem components."" Canada needs to consider similar measures to protect and foster a potentially lucrative Arctic fishery, says Michael Byers, a University of British Columbia expert in polar politics.

Eastern Ontario, the Maritime and parts of the northeastern US also have been hit hard. More than 30 hydro towers fell during the night and early morning around the city, and transmission lines from the Beauharnois and Les Cedres generating stations and several substations were knocked out.","The plans became controversial when some Parti Quebecois members complained they would require the hiring of too many bilingual employees at French health-care institutions, and that would conflict with the right to work in French. Rochon then agreed to allow the Office de la Langue Francaise to review the plans, sparking an angry reaction from some anglophone groups, who said they feared the government would try to reduce access to English-language services. The Office told Rochon in March they did not have enough information on how the plans would be put into action to give an opinion. The minister had said a decision on the plans would be made in June, and then said two weeks ago he expected a decision in the next few weeks. David Birnbaum, executive director of Alliance Quebec, said the delay means the English community is left without effective access plans, since the 1989 plans now in effect were drawn up long before the massive changes to Quebec's health-care system.

South China's springtime anticyclone, a weather pattern that brings rain to the sub-tropical provinces along the coast, shifted about 300 kilometres northward this year. ""This drew the annual rain season in the area forward by about 20 days,"" he said. But scientific questions are not a priority for most of the 114 million Chinese affected by this year's floods as they struggle to cope with the devastation. Violence has broken out over flood-control efforts that include diverting waters into villages to save railways, an official newspaper said yesterday. The national police newspaper reported some residents of flood-ravaged areas battled authorities trying to control swollen rivers.

The singular thing was that the Pixie, the rescuing vessel, had herself been driven out of Trepassey bay by the storm, had her mainsail and try-sail carried away, and was forced round Cape Race far north, and thus at last was brought in sight of the sinking Ruby just in time to take off her crew. Captain Lake, of the Pixie, deserves great praise for his brave conduct. He and two of his men were badly frost bitten. His own crippled condition and the state of the weather would have been a sufficient excuse for declining the risk of attempting a rescue, but the brave men never hesitated, they saw their brothers in dire distress, and at the risk of their lives they saved them from the jaws of death."

The plan, explained Allison Wells of Cornell, is to jot down the largest number of birds of a single species you see at any single time, where they were observed, what time of day, and then enter the data online at the website the bird-count organizers have set up. It's the week before spring migrations begin, and the observations will allow ornithologists to begin assessing the distribution and abundance of North American birds. The findings will be especially valuable in assessing the impact last year's weather havoc had on birds, said Audubon Society vice-president Frank Gill. The phenomenon known as El Nino brought unprecedented levels of rain to the West Coast, induced a hot, dry summer in the American Southeast and might have been responsible for the devastating ice storms that hit Quebec, Ontario and the northeastern US last year.

Anderson Research concluded ""the public seems mostly unmoved"" by criticism of the budget's replacement of the monthly family allowance cheque with benefits to help the neediest. Nearly half even doubted direct help to poor families trickles down to their children. And, while nearly two-thirds of those surveyed didn't like Ottawa rescinding its daycare pledge at budget time, they also didn't rate daycare as the cure they once did. The budget left Canadians feeling simultaneously ""frugal, better off and charitable,"" Anderson concluded. But Decima found there was a high level of concern on children's issues and a low level of satisfaction with the government. Decima asked who had credibility on children's issues. Health-care professionals, local community service groups and social agencies rated highest. Least credible were members of Parliament and federal and provincial government representatives. Decima found education and drug and alcohol abuse were considered the most important issues facing children, while Anderson found the quality of the environment was considered the biggest potential threat to the well-being of children.","""Weather takes shine off Britain's grouse hunt LONDON Disease, predators and bad weather meant a less than glorious start yesterday to the annual grouse-shooting season in Scotland and northern England.

During the weekend the board of the Vatican employees' union which represents about half the 2,000 non-clerical workers resigned in protest against what it called intransigence by senior prelates over workers' requests. ""With regret, we have to report the defeat of the path of dialogue and collaboration,"" a union statement said. It was the boldest action ever taken by the Association of Lay Vatican Employees and could lead to the first strike in the history of Vatican City, said church sources. In a toughly worded statement, the nine-member board said Vatican officials have repeatedly delayed action on their requests for raises in salaries and pensions. ""After seven years since the last increase, it is no longer possible to ask us to have patience,"" the statement said.","The ceremony marked his return to what is expected to be a normal schedule after 10 weeks of convalescence.

The group of beatified included 17 Irish martyrs four bishops, six priests, a monk, a housewife, three sailors, a baker and a merchant killed between 1579 and 1654. The killings took place during a political struggle to establish and consolidate the Protestant power of England in Ireland following the split between Rome and Henry VIII in 1534. The subjugation of the Irish became an aim of the Tudor monarchs. Revolts, partly inspired by Roman Catholic opposition to the reformation, were suppressed. Irish resistance culminated in the rebellion of 1641 and was not suppressed until Oliver Cromwell invaded in 1649. Water rushed through the streets in the town of Rennes-les-Bains near Carcassonne, where an elderly woman drowned when her house collapsed and two people were missing.","Water in fields on the Senneville-Pierrefonds border spilled across Anse a l'Orme Rd and forced the closing of the road at Gouin Blvd. While the water is lapping at the edge of several Pierrefonds properties, none of the houses has been flooded and no one has been moved out, said Johanne Palladini, a spokesman for the city. We've been taking flood-prevention measures for the last two days, she said, noting that city officials are constantly monitoring water levels, which rose about 9 centimetres yesterday alone. She said the public-works department has supplied residents with sandbags and the city has distributed pamphlets on flooding. In neighbouring Ste.

In low places along the banks of the Black River the country was inundated for a considerable distance. St. Eustache presented the appearance of a miniature Venice. Three or four families had to abandon their houses and seek shelter with their more fortunate neighbors, while others retook themselves to the upper stories of their houses to escape the water which covered the lower portions to a depth of two or three feet.

Belleville, Ont., April 16. The ice in the river Moira moved downstream today carrying with it the immense accumulations above Bloecker's and Coleman's dams. It jammed two hundred yards from the starting point and the water rose to a great height, flooding many cellars on Front and Coleman streets. It shoved again and the lower bridge, a fine iron structure, had a narrow escape from being swept away, as the water rose so high that the ice struck the footwalks and handrails. But at the critical moment, as the bridge was being lifted from its piers, the ice again jammed, leaving the bridge in great danger until this evening, when the pressure was relieved by a natural movement of the ice which was swept off to the side on the streets in Murray ward, all of which is now flooded deeply and blocked by immense cakes of ice.

This time, meteorologists say, the storms were brought about by an unusual convergence of atmospheric forces that also caused the mild winter weather in most of North America during January and February. The European storms of Jan. 25, Feb. 3, and Feb. 26 battered Great Britain and the Continent with winds surpassing 160 kilometres per hour.

The general condition of oats is 80, instead of 92.3 last month; of rye 91.5; of barley 88.0, instead of 90.0; of buckwheat 92.1, instead of 96.2; of tobacco 70.2, a reduction from 84.4. The percentage of stock hogs available for fattening is 101; condition 98. The corn crop is a week late in a large proportion of its breadth. On the Atlantic coast rains were excessive and floods injured fields in bottom lands. Early in the season the temperature was low, interfering with germination and cultivation. The uplands enjoyed conditions favorable to rapid growth. On the gulf coast there was some excess of moisture until June and July, with drought in some districts since, and in others seasonable showers resulting in crops expressed by medium to high averages. In the Ohio valley and lake region there has been a marked reduction of condition during the last month from drought following the heavy rains of early summer. In Ohio and Indiana there was previous injury of bottom land crops by floods.","5 07 A GREAT DROUGHT FEARED The Crops in the West Imperilled by Lack of Moisture ELOPEMENT AND MURDER Unheard Violent Races Encounter in the Mouth Bush in the Sioux and in Dakota Washington, May 12 The week ending May 11 was unusually warm throughout the Northern States, the average daily temperature ranging from 9 degrees to 15 degrees above the normal, while in the Southern States the temperature was slightly cooler than usual along the Gulf and South Atlantic coast The season from January 1 to May 11 is about one week in advance in New England, New York and Pennsylvania and the central valleys, and it is from ten to twenty days earlier in the Northwest, while in the Southern States thermal conditions are about normal The weather for the week has been marked by an entire absence of rain throughout the Southern States and the Ohio valley, this area of no rain being larger than that of any other week since the issue of the weather crop bulletin The drought conditions in the Ohio valley have become more threatening, leaving the growing crops in that section in a critical condition, if not permanently injured Eight showers occurred over New England and the Middle Atlantic states, and generous rains, although usually less than the normal for the week, are reported from Wisconsin"
What specific ecological impact of the bush fires mentioned in the passage has contributed to the deficiencies in wheat crops in the Western States?,"The long absence of rain in some parts of Ontario and Quebec has also occasioned a good deal of harm. In this region the ""sultry term"" ended on the afternoon of the 7th inst, after a brief gale of wind from the north-west; and the atmosphere has been clear and cool since then with the feeling of a sudden transition from an extreme summer temperature to a bracing autumn. The highest temperature in this city during daytime, since 2nd inst, was 89�� on Wednesday the change occurred on afternoon of that day, and 56�� was registered during the night, showing a fall of 33�� within about 12 hours. The mean temperature of the first seven days of the present month was 74��. A thunderstorm passed along the Ottawa Valley on the afternoon of the 3rd instant, and caused much damage; and similar storms were experienced here on the 4th and 5th instant. The bush fires, which have been so prevalent in the United States and Canada, have destroyed much standing timber and other property fog and smoke darkening the air in some places, and otherwise aggravating the sultriness.","THE WHEAT CROP The partial failure of the wheat crop has been foreseen. It is due chiefly to unfavorable weather last winter. The heaviest damage is in Kansas, where in nearly thirty counties the crop is a total failure. The state's yield will be, it is alleged, but 40 per cent of an average. This means a reduction of over 40,000,000 bushels in the crop in that state alone, for Kansas is the greatest wheat country in the world. Its production last year was over 70,000,000 bushels. Illinois and Missouri wheat also suffered heavily from the said cause. Spring wheat has been greatly damaged in North Dakota and some other sections by drought. This has been broken within a day or two and the outlook is improving. Another element in the reduction of the wheat crop is the decreased acreage, due to farmers abandoning its culture on account of low prices and putting in barley, oats, and other grains instead. The Pacific states report increased acreage and good prospects. The same is true of Manitoba and the Northwest territories. In Canada, the crop will be about as usual.","The bulls who have been crying ""dollar wheat,"" however, have not been silenced by the tumble of the last two days. The banker said that the election uncertainty made it imperative for conservative banks to decline loans for speculation to large sums. London, October 22. The Daily News, in its market review tomorrow, will say that the exaggerated views regarding wheat which prevailed Monday are giving place to more reasonable ideas. The position is serious, but not hopeless. The sellers of Russian wheat still show a great reserve, but there is a question whether the Black Sea shippers are not playing into the hands of the Americans by holding their stocks. The Russian crop is certainly smaller than that of 1895, but there has not failed to be a material surplus for exportation. The chief difficulty is a scarcity of tonnage, which in less than three months has tripled freights from the Black Sea. The weakest point in Great Britain is the lowness of the stocks. Adelaide, October 22. There has been a total failure in the harvest in the northern part of South Australia, caused by a long-continued drought. Numbers of farmers have been ruined by the loss of their crops and are in a destitute condition."

The problem, to some extent, might be that the government is having difficulty convincing the public that there is nothing to worry about. The nation saw the Communist Party cover up and play down the early spread of SARS, and some may be reluctant to accept the official line that recovered SARS patients are not infectious. In addition, although state media outlets have reported that recovered patients can't spread SARS, there has been no wall-to-wall public propaganda campaign on behalf of the nearly 5,000 SARS survivors in China. That stands in contrast to the relentless propaganda on television and radio and in newspapers celebrating doctors and nurses such as Wang during the worst days of SARS.

"How does the CLEAN LIVING initiative, with its allocated budget and grants, aim to support environmental and heritage groups in response to the ecological impacts of the freak thunderstorms and subsequent flooding in the northeastern Mediterranean coast as described in the passage?","Environmental groups in Scandinavia have for years been trying to expedite the cleanup of the Baltic, but until recently they have had few counterparts in what was once the Eastern Bloc. Now the Baltic has emerged as one of the chief concerns of the old East Bloc's fledgling environmental organizations.

The former, started by the green parties of the region, aims at general environmental and political cooperation.

This air of informal cooperation seems to be invigorating efforts at the governmental level. In September, just two weeks after the Clean Baltic Coalition was officially founded, the prime ministers of all seven Baltic countries met to discuss the state of their shared environment. Moreover, it appears that Western governments are finally beginning to allocate to the Baltic the substantial amounts of money that will be necessary to back up their commitments. Although no money has yet been specifically earmarked for the Baltic, Sweden, Denmark and Finland have offered a combined amount of more than $160 million for environmental aid to Eastern Europe.","Environmental groups in Scandinavia have for years been trying to expedite the cleanup of the Baltic, but until recently they have had few counterparts in what was once the Eastern Bloc.

The meeting was among the last of a series of riding-level sessions to elect delegates and adopt resolutions on various issues to be presented at the party's convention in May. One of those issues is Quebec's ailing health-care system. In a morning workshop, and later in his speech to his members, Bouchard said Quebec still has one of the best and most generous health-care systems in the world, but there must be a public debate on its future. ""With an aging population and expensive new technology, health-care costs are rising faster than the province's economy,"" he said. If it is to preserve the universality and the accessibility of health care, Quebec must do things differently, Bouchard said. For example, people who years ago used to go to their family doctor are now going to emergency rooms for care, he explained. ""We have to improve the organization of services. I am convinced we can improve accessibility and waiting times if we intervene in a more immediate way."" However, he rejected proposals to introduce private health care."

Western and central Quebec were hit by a thunderstorm bad enough to warrant a severe weather warning last night. It began in eastern Ontario, sweeping a path east through the Outaouais, Laurentians and Lanaudière regions. The Montreal area was brushed by the storm before it headed southeast towards the Townships and Beauce regions. The winds probably hit 80 kilometres per hour, according to Environment Canada officials. In Montreal, heavy winds and rain started at 6 p.m. and lasted about one hour, officials said. The island received between 10 and 13 millimetres of rain. Other areas didn't fare so well, Sûreté du Québec officials said fallen trees blocked off a road in Notre-Dame-du-Laus in the Outaouais region.

"What specific human health impact of thunder-related events is highlighted in the passage, and how does it compare to other natural disasters in terms of fatalities in North America?","""I often say there's more violence on the weather channel than on regular news,"" he said. The often-dramatic images of floods, hurricanes, droughts or other extreme weather events - no matter where on the planet they occur - have led us to believe that there are more such extreme events than ever. The number of events has actually remained relatively constant, but we're more aware of them. And when weather causes damage these days, it comes with a heftier price tag and the accompanying larger headlines, in part because human beings insist on building things where they know, or ought to know, they shouldn't. It was rare, Phillips said, to have a $1-billion damage figure attached to a weather event in the United States before 1987. But since that date, there have been 31 events with damage in the billions, he said. That is not only a function of inflation; it's because humans have continued to install luxury hotels and condominiums along the vulnerable coasts of the Carolinas, Florida and other hurricane-prone seaboard states. Indeed, when it comes to so-called natural disasters, which get people talking about the weather to no end, ""the fingerprints of human beings are all over those events,"" Phillips said.","As much as $91 billion a year a groundbreaking federal study says. The research paper pegs the price of Canada's 1994 jobless rate of 10.4 per cent at $29 billion to $77 billion in lost productivity and another $14 billion in health crime and other social costs. The figures indicate Canada with an unemployment rate stuck at around 10 per cent this year once again stands to lose tens of billions of dollars to joblessness. The Human Resources Department study takes a rare look beyond the direct productivity costs of unemployment to measure the toll on physical and mental health marriages and communities. ""We have to take account of those costs when we are talking about unemployment,"" said study author Marcel. Bedard, a researcher with the federal department, reviewed existing research and discovered, if not a certain link, strong indications that unemployment can cause higher levels of illness, premature death and crime. Experts agree on the reasons: Malnutrition among the poor, resulting in chronic disease. Generally higher stress levels in low-income groups, associated with mental disorders, alcoholism, suicide, accidents, heart disease and other illnesses due to high blood pressure. The unemployed are not the only ones to suffer the consequences of these problems, says Bedard's study, completed in June.","Northeast While there are signs that the pattern of the last two months is weakening, Wagner said, it is too soon to tell whether it is ending, or if a reversal will in fact occur this spring. Heart defect? You can blame your firefighter parents RON KOTULAK AND JON VAN CHICAGO TRIBUNE CHICAGO ""Pick your parents wisely"" is standard tongue-in-cheek advice doctors give when asked the best way to ensure a long, healthy life, because genetics is so important a factor. If it were possible to take that advice, babies might avoid picking firefighters as parents. In a study published in the February American Journal of Epidemiology, analysis of more than 22,000 children born with birth defects revealed that firefighters' children had a greater risk of being born with an abnormal opening between their left and right heart chambers than did the offspring of police officers. While, as social groups, police officers and firefighters are much alike, it appears that firefighters' work exposes them to more toxins, which in turn affects the genes they pass on to their children.

TEHRAN The toll in the earthquake that jolted northern Iran early yesterday rose to at least 25,000 dead, with tens of thousands reported injured, and it could go much higher when rescuers reach remote areas. The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, said yesterday afternoon on Cable News Network that the latest word he has received from the Foreign Ministry in Tehran was that an earlier estimate of at least 10,000 dead was far too conservative. And he said that even the latest figures are likely to increase as rescuers reach remote areas. Iran needs medical equipment, blood, blankets and medicine, he said. ""I understand that international organizations are trying their best to bring some of this equipment and medicine."" The earlier estimate was contained in a statement by the Iranian cabinet, made public after an emergency evening session. The announcement carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency placed all government organizations on full alert, and ordered an air bridge set up between Tehran and the stricken areas to evacuate survivors. Landslides blocked rescuers on the ground, and bad weather hindered helicopters trying to fly in supplies and take out victims, the news agency reported."
