From Saturday noon until Monday night we were at the mercy of the ocean, driven hither and thither by a succession of winds, suffering indescribably from hunger, thirst, exhaustion and exposure and fearing that we would be engulfed by every wave that dashed against our frail craft.

In regard to the duplicate sewer in St James street, from McGill street to the western city limits, the necessity of building this sewer has been caused entirely by the action of the municipality of Lachine and the municipality of St Henri, diverting a natural water course which used to drain into the little St Pierre river into their sewers which empty into the St James street sewer.","The natural conclusion is that the houses must have been built since the sewer was constructed, and therefore, the city should not be held responsible.

What political impact might the delay in the Finance committee's response to the recommendation for the de Levis street intercepting sewer have on the city's infrastructure planning as outlined in Perival W St George's report?,"I have repeatedly notified the city of their action and have asked the city to allow me to dam the end of our sewer so as to prevent the water coming from Lachine and St Henri doing damage to the properties of the citizens of Montreal, but so far I have received no instructions to do so, and in consequence, the cellars of the properties on that street, and also on the adjoining streets, are nearly always flooded in heavy rain storms; therefore, it is necessary to build this sewer, and the cost of same should be charged to these two municipalities, and I would advise the city to notify them notarially of it.

In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost.","The accounts of the Coney Island Jockey Club show a startling falling off in receipts for 1895.

After the investigation noted above, it was predicted that in 1872, at the time when the earth would reach that point in its orbit at which Biela's comet would have crossed had it been in existence, there would be a display of meteors.

He had had, he said, an interview with the street railway authorities before going to Quebec, and had called a meeting of his committee in consequence, to see if they could not come to a satisfactory arrangement.

Mr. Cunningham had written, on behalf of the Street Railway Company, stating that the continuance of the removal of snow by the company had been rendered impossible by the action of the Health Committee, and unless something was done they would have to ask the city to remove it from the tracks to the curb. Considering this, the Road Committee had decided to ask the council for $30,000 to remove the snow from the streets on which the Street Railway passes."
"What specific impacts did the tornado have on the infrastructure and human health in Galesbima, Ill, particularly concerning the Free Methodist church and the rink?","- WRECKED BY A TORNADO Western Town Devastated by an Awful Windstorm Some Train Train Escapes GALESBIMA, Ill, June 14 The tornado passed through the northeastern part of this (Knox) county about eight o'clock last evening and ruin was left all along its path. It first made its appearance northwest of Galva. About 7:30 o'clock two threatening clouds were seen in the west approaching one another, and the tornado is thought to have resulted from their junction. Its course was south and east through that city, and the main body of the storm passed along the main business street of the city. It came with such suddenness that the citizens had no time to fly to places of safety. In the Free Methodist church there was assembled a congregation. In the rink there was gathering a committee to arrange for a Fourth of July celebration. The church was quickly a mass of ruins and the congregation was imprisoned. A number were injured, one dangerously. The rink also was blown down, but those inside managed to escape without injury. Had the storm come a few minutes later many would have been in the building and a loss of life would surely have resulted. The roar of the storm is described as terrible.","When this is complete the by-law will be considered. On Tuesday night there will be a special meeting of the council to take up the gas contract. An effort was made yesterday morning to get a meeting for tomorrow evening, a most unusual thing for the council to meet on Saturday, but after a conference between the City Clerk and those anxious for the meeting, it was deferred to Tuesday night. The Street Railway company owes the city $47,000 for removing the snow from the tracks last winter.

The scoring was Wales five minor points, England two, leaving the match drawn in favor of the home team.

ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD Telegraphic Communication Cut Off by Rainstorm Great Damage to Telephone and Other Wires. The thaw in the past two days has had a devastating effect upon our streets, buildings, trees, and telegraphic wires. The streets and sidewalks were almost impassable, and by common consent the sidewalks were almost deserted on Sunday, pedestrians preferring to take to the middle of the streets. Saturday, however, with the thaw which set in in the morning and the sprinkling of ashes, walking was once more rendered possible.","Many people feared to seek their beds, but were at last driven there by the force of fatigue. The scene outside was wild, weird and appalling. No such downfall is recollected to have taken place since 1836, but as the country was not then cleared the water did not rise either as high or so rapidly, and it passed gradually away. On Tuesday night and early on Wednesday morning it was precipitated from the clouds in overwhelming quantities. Rushing, by the force of gravitation, through the numerous drains and water-courses, it accumulated in the main artery of the Thames, finally to be rushed down in concentrated power of the two branches of the river at London. The first disaster took place at Saunby's Dam, situated on the North Branch, at a distance of about half a mile up the stream. This gave way first at the gates, and then the whole line of structure yielded, and went down. It was no doubt the sudden impact of the body of water and material thus let loose that gave the first decisive blow to the abutment works at the new Oxford Street bridge, a much admired work of engineering, which had been but recently opened to the public."

The wall was blown over, and Gros Louis sustained a fracture of the skull. He was first taken to his home, 42 Frontenac street, but the physician advised his transportation to the Notre Dame hospital, where he is now lying in a very critical condition. At Cote St. Antoine plenty of damage was done and one man injured. This was John Wise, who, while standing on Greene avenue, had his leg broken by a portion of a roof falling on him. He was sent to the General hospital in the ambulance. The Storm In the Harbor On the wharves and the harbor the storm was terrific, the wind sweeping everything before it. During the short time that it lasted it wrought considerable damage.

In many places it was almost cyclonic in its violence and the long list of disasters includes a large loss of life, many wrecks of large vessels and the loss of scores, if not hundreds, of smaller craft, with serious damage to property ashore at many important towns. In the north the wind was accompanied by blinding snow and hail that hid the lights and immensely increased the difficulties of navigation. Many ships are known to have foundered, in most cases, it is feared with all on board.","However, if the Senate's volubility is not exhausted, there are signs that the public's patience is, and even a U.

"What specific measures were taken to ensure the safety of the crew aboard the large steamer stranded at Merry Castle during the blinding storm, and how did these measures impact the crew's health and safety?","Fine clear weather was experienced until the 19th at 1 o'clock, on the morning of which day Cape Rosier was passed. Early in the day the wind freshened, then began to increase in strength, until when darkness came on a stiff gale was blowing. Early in the night the wind and sea continued to increase, a heavy snowstorm set in and all about the ship was dense blackness of night, and the eyes of those watching above could see very little ahead. At 10:30 o'clock, when the storm was blowing fiercely, and those on deck consisted of the captain, George T. Draper and three men, the captain gave the signal to stop. Chief engineer Hutchinson was in the boiler-room alone, and he at once sprang to shut off the steam from his engines, but he had hardly started to turn the lever when the signal sounded full speed astern. Less than ten seconds later, before the order given by the captain could be carried out, the steamer STRUCK WITH A TERRIBLE SHOCK. The engines were reversed and kept working to try and drag her off, but of no avail. She had grounded on a sand beach, and bumped and pitched about, continually refusing to stir.","Less than ten seconds later, before the order given by the captain could be carried out, the steamer STRUCK WITH A TERRIBLE SHOCK. The engines were reversed and kept working to try and drag her off, but of no avail. She had grounded on a sand beach, and bumped and pitched about, continually refusing to stir. The engines were kept running until it was seen to be useless to attempt to get her off, and then Captain Evans stopped them. After half an hour had passed, the engineer shut off steam and eased the valves. By this time all the ship's hands, most of whom had turned in for the night, were collected, getting the boats ready to abandon the ship. Hutchinson set to work to help, and soon all were swung in their davits to be lowered at a moment's notice. Having done everything that could be done, the crew took shelter in the houses above the deck and in the chart, galley, and salerooms, until the storm moderated. All were cool and collected, and obeyed the captain's orders.","The darkness began to fall and the storm increased to a hurricane, bearing on its wings blinding drifts of snow. The cold became intense, and thick darkness settled over the awful scene. No words could depict the horrors of that night. The roaring of the storm, the deadening crash of the ice masses, the cries and groans of the poor sufferers, as they tried to keep up the circulation by walking rapidly around, often stumbling against each other or falling over the prostrate bodies of those who, overcome with the fierce cold, had fallen to rise no more. Death in a more awful form could not be imagined. It is hard enough for us to die on our soft beds, tended by loving hands and having every comfort at hand; but to die in the grim, icy wilderness, pierced by blighting Arctic winds, far from home or help of any kind, the heart torn by thought of wives and children, of mothers and sisters left desolate, to hear the savage howl of the storm and feel the strength sinking and then resign all hope and lie down to be wrapped in a snowy shroud, surely this was enough to make the stoutest heart quail."

A storm was prevailing at the time and those who were close to the water felt a black heavy cloud drawing near the city.

Sunday's gale, which was totally unexpected, advanced in a northeasterly direction across the Bay of Biscay. A blizzard prevailed over the whole of the south of England; it commenced in London at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The storm increased in fury at night, and there was an unusual rise of the tide. All the channel steamers had boisterous passages. Even in the harbors, the water was so rough that it was difficult to hold vessels to their moorings. The Dover mail boat nearly sank in the harbor; her paddle box was completely smashed. The mail service steamers cannot cross the channel. The sea makes a clean breach over the Admiralty pier, where the telegraph clerk and a signal man are practically prisoners. Similar reports come from points all along the coast.

A storm started in Texas on Thursday morning. This afternoon that same storm was dispersing off the coast of Newfoundland, causing very heavy gales, which, it is feared, have done serious damage to shipping. In the Southern states, the effects of the storm were cyclonic, and as wires are down but little news has been learned of its effects, though it is not supposed to have been particularly serious. From Texas, the storm struck the foot of Lake Michigan, and Chicago was laid under tribute by a heavy snowfall which delayed all trains entering the city. Here the storm divided. One section of it went through the northwest and west, everywhere causing a heavy fall of snow and blocking not only the railways, but traffic of all kinds. A cold wave accompanied, going as far west as the Rockies and away up into the Canadian Northwest, where some very low temperatures were recorded.","A forecaster for Pennsylvania State University, Fred Gadomski, said he was ""amazed"" Friday to see a television station leading its newscast with a storm that had not yet even formed, and calling it ""one in 50 years."" ""It was amazing that something that is a predicted event - as opposed to news that has occurred - was the biggest story of the day,"" Gadomski said. ""I can see when it's a big earthquake or tornado, but this was different."" ""Yeah, the storm was hyped,"" said Peter Wichrowski, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, which supplied reports on the storm as it evolved - from what seemed would be a two-day blizzard centred on New York City into a modest March storm. North of New York, however, the storm was the real thing. Schools through much of western Nova Scotia were closed as the storm began bearing down on the Maritimes. Heavy snowfall and wind warnings were posted as far east as Halifax. Strong winds and snow had hit the Yarmouth, N.S., area by yesterday morning, where the forecast called for up to 30 centimetres of snow.","From Texas, the storm struck the foot of Lake Michigan, and Chicago was laid under tribute by a heavy snowfall which delayed all trains entering the city.

Moscow's new mayor Sergei Sobyanin, under pressure to live up to his enforcer image after taking over from longstanding incumbent Yury Luzhkov this year, vowed that the situation would return to normal yesterday. The situation was extraordinary, he told the ITAR-TASS news agency. A third of the monthly precipitation fell. This would have been fine if it had been just snow. But this was freezing rain which caused electricity, trolleybus and tramlines to freeze up. He said that some 15,000 units of equipment were deployed to clear the roads. After 17 hours of snowfall dropped 50 cm on New York's Central Park, the city was covered. Snow drifts piled 90 to 150 cm in some areas and giant mounds accumulated on the sidewalks where snow plows cleared the streets."

MISERABLE CONDITIONS were not uncommon, but the relieving snow was everywhere abundant. The storm appears to have swept over the whole eastern portion of the North American continent, between the Rocky Mountains and the Atlantic. It was first heard from on Monday, when the Meteorological office at Toronto reported its appearance early on Sunday in the west and northwest. The ""depression"" appears from the reports to have moved from southwest to northeast, and been encountered or followed by an ""anti-cyclone centre"" generated in the extreme Northwest.

Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable. Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile. Suburban traffic was blocked for several hours in the morning and after that trains ran at long intervals. All trains were delayed. Some that were due in the early morning hours had not been heard from at night. The superintendent of mails in the general Post Office reported that the mail train from Boston, due at 6 a.m., had not been heard from, nor had the mails been received up to 10 o'clock tonight. The incoming mails from other parts, he said, were from two hours to an unknown number of hours behind time. The damage to small shipping in the harbor and down the bay was very great. It is reported tonight that several tugboats belonging to the Kingston Towing Company, together with a large number of canal boats, were sunk up the river by the force of the gale.","IS 1 The coldest weather ever known in Kentucky was recorded today. At Louisville the thermometer only reached 10 below, but the state suffered much more.

Powerful thunderstorms swept through the New York metropolitan area yesterday morning, snapping trees, damaging hundreds of cars and buildings, and throwing the morning commute into chaos. The severe weather was blamed for at least one death and a handful of injuries. As a strong blast of rain pounded the city, nearly every subway station was flooded or shut down, forcing commuters out onto the streets and into taxis and buses, and bringing traffic in many areas to a standstill. The Long Island Rail Road, Metro North, and New Jersey Transit all were affected, and the region's three major airports—La Guardia, Kennedy, and Newark—were reporting flight cancellations and long delays. There was also concern that many beaches would be closed as health inspectors sought to determine whether over-flooded sewage systems had contaminated rivers and shorelines. The destruction inflicted by the heavy rains was magnified in Brooklyn by intense winds that tore up trees and ripped apart homes and buildings."

London - Snow storms across western Europe killed at least five people yesterday and brought travel chaos, grounding most flights at London's Heathrow airport after one jet slid off a taxiway. Two climbers died on Mount Snowdon in Wales and three people were killed in accidents and from the cold in Italy. Despite five days of severe weather warnings, British transport bosses still appeared to have been caught out as up to 30 centimetres of snow fell across the country, bringing rail, air and road networks to a halt.","Two trains full of passengers in the Midlands were snowed up last night and the passengers were not rescued until this morning. The rescued people suffered terribly from cold during the night, owing to the unheated condition of the cars. A train on the North Kent railroad, bound for this city, was snowed up last night and still remains in the rail cut, where it was stopped by a drift. A Mail Car Lost The Sheeuse's mail car cannot be found; it has been lost somewhere along the line of the railroad between this city and Sheerness. A searching party sent out after the missing mail car rescued the clerk. He was found half frozen in a snowdrift. Two clergymen were snowed up in a carriage on the Faversham road last night and were rescued with difficulty after having suffered severely. Reports from the provinces show that the blizzard prevailed from the St. George's Channel to the North Sea. One of the effects of the storm has been the stoppage of the South Wales Iron Works. All road traffic is stopped, and the trains there are delayed. In Somersetshire, Dorsetshire, Hampshire and Gloucestershire there are snowdrifts everywhere many feet deep, rendering field work impossible.","Two climbers died on Mount Snowdon in Wales and three people were killed in accidents and from the cold in Italy.

They faced a growing public backlash as one in five workers was left stranded at home, at an estimated cost to the economy of $2 billion. In London, all bus services were cancelled for the first time in living memory, as a network which had carried on running during the Blitz - and during much worse conditions in 1963 - proved unable to deal with 15 cm of snow. Cancelled subway trains added to the chaos in the capital. At one stage, it was estimated that there were 1,600 kilometres of traffic jams across the country. London's snowfall was the most recorded in the British capital in 18 years. The storms also hit France and Spain, closing roads and rail tracks, and spread as far south as Morocco.

Yesterday the machinery gave out and wind and sea were running so high that the captain decided to run ashore after cutting the most away; there are about 500 women among the passengers. The steamer is in no immediate danger. The steamer's appearance gives unmistakable evidence of hard usage by the waves and the absence of masts and rigging, together with the general disorder of her deck, makes her a most distressing object, while the poor foreigners who crowd the decks gazing longingly at the land, so near and yet so far, created feelings of commiseration in the hearts of the hundreds of men who swarmed to the beach from all points along the mainland. For nearly twenty days the steamer met a series of storms, the waves dashing over the decks like huge mountains, and at times threatening to entirely submerge her.","the captain shouted, and he and his officers stooped down, clutched the railing of the bridge and braced themselves for the avalanche of water that was coming, Both the huge waves merged together as they struck the bow of the steamship, broke clear over the bridge and, according to many of the seamen, reached halfway up the big funnel, The seamen had not had time to grasp the iron railing which extended along the sides of the cabin, and most of them were swept off along the decks and hurled against the posts sustaining the lifeboat and against the sides of the cabin, Quartermaster Merry was thrown over the side where the rail was swept away, struck the shrouds and landed away aft on the main deck below, Carpenter Cartelyn, who had his left thigh broken by striking one of the posts, lodged among the shrouds and clung there until saved, HURRY IN ITS WAKE, The wave passed over the ship so quickly that the men did not know what had struck them, It left ruin in its wake, Moans and groans came from among the lifeboats aft, and those who were not injured went to the assistance of their companions, Three of them were found lying under the lifeboats and the others","The members of the crew who were on the ice could not regain the vessel and were exposed to the terrible weather throughout the night and all of the next day. Forty-eight men perished and between fifty and sixty were so badly frost-bitten that the amputation of one or more of their limbs will have to be undergone by all of them. The Greenland succeeded in recovering the bodies of the victims, but the remaining twenty-three were buried beneath the snow drifts. From the circumstances of the disaster, it is feared that other steamers have suffered in a similar manner. The city is in a terrible state of excitement. The disaster is the worst recorded in the history of the sealing industry. Most of the victims were married men. On Sunday night a heavy gale raged all along the Atlantic seaboard of the island and reached the northern latitude, where the Greenland, as cruising, being frozen solidly in the floe, sent her crew out on the ice, perhaps ten or twenty miles in search of seals. When the storm arose, the men, scattered over the floe in parties of two or three, tried to make for the ship. The first watch, which started from farthest away from the ship, is the watch which lost the most men."

THE QUEEN Queen Victoria is taking keen interest just now in the progress of the scheme for connecting Cape Town with Cairo. She conversed with General Lord Kitchener on the subject during his recent visit to Her Majesty, and she expressed the hope of living to see it carried through. The dislike of the Queen for the late William K. Gladstone was well known, but since the death of the great statesman Her Majesty has given several proofs of her kindly regard for Mrs. Gladstone, the widow. She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks. There is some discussion this week as to whether the Queen will again go to the south of France next spring, in view of the Anglophobe feeling excited by the Fashoda dispute.","These outbursts on the part of the French newspapers are having a certain effect, and letters are appearing in the English newspapers urging that pressure be exercised in the proper quarters to induce the Queen not to go to the French Riviera, but to go to Florence instead.

Monday evening the snow began to fall about five o'clock, the wind increased and at ten o'clock the storm was at its height, pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the streets became a matter of much difficulty, and no one ventured outside doors except those whose business commanded it. Yesterday morning when our citizens began to set out from their houses to commence the duties of the day they experienced the full inconveniences of the storm.","After reaching the bottom they explored the tunnel some distance, and at the mouth of one of the chambers in the vicinity of the engine, discovered a body, which is supposed to be that of the colored fireman, Robert Simmonds.

How did the snowstorm specifically affect railway communication and mail delivery in the context of Mr. Graham's Montreal & Toronto Railway and the mail trains at Three Rivers?,"This gentleman had considerable fault to find with both controversialists. THE SNOW STORM Succeeded by Slush-The Delays to the Trains, It is probably not within the recollection of the oldest resident that there has been such a snowstorm in the month of April as that of Friday and Saturday. In many of the streets of the city the roads were so heavy that sleighs could scarcely get along. The storm was succeeded by rain and sleet, which had the effect of rendering the sidewalks slippery, and of also loosening the snow upon the roofs resulting in frequent snow slides and making it dangerous for pedestrians. The thaw had so thoroughly set in yesterday as to make walking most disagreeable. Telephone and telegraph wires were also thrown down in many cases while persons were removing the snow from the roofs of houses, and the wires were so badly damaged in the West that no communication could be had by telegraph with many of the leading points. The storm had a most serious effect on the running of trains. The Central Vermont and Delaware and Hudson did not suffer so much as the other roads. The Grand Trunk trains suffered seriously through snow at Lachine.","Paris, February 7: In the Chamber of Deputies today, M.

THE GREAT STORM: Havoc in the Country—Highways and Railways Blocked in all Directions. Richmond, Que., February 7: A severe storm has been raging here since yesterday morning, commencing about 10 a.m. with a heavy fall of snow from the southwest, which lasted with more or less violence till evening, when the wind veered to the north and west and has continued blowing with increased violence all day with no signs of abatement. The roads are all blocked up. All the trains have been cancelled on the South Eastern branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway.","Everybody who could by any means stay indoors did so, and as for those whom necessity compelled to turn out, well, the carters got the bulk of them; in fact, the hackmen were about the only persons who had no ill to say of the storm. The Street railway succeeded in having all their lines clear by noon and from then up to now they have been running on schedule time. As an instance of the business they did on Saturday, their receipts amounted to $1,200, $600 more than on any other storm day. Eleven inches of snow fell during Saturday and Sunday. The snowstorm which raged all day Saturday interfered considerably with the prompt arrival of the trains, although the west appears to have been more severely visited than the east. The Toronto morning train on Saturday did not reach Montreal till long after noon, while the Grand Trunk express was four hours late in the evening. Things had however, got into better shape yesterday, when both the Canadian Pacific and Grand Trunk trains were but little behind schedule time. The snow storm, which showed itself so early on Saturday morning, while it did not affect to a very appreciable extent the main lines of the Canadian Pacific, certainly embarrassed the branches."

There is much suffering to man and beast everywhere in this section, but only a few fatalities are reported in the immediate vicinity. Three Indian school children lost their way in the heavily falling snow and perished Saturday night. In the sparsely settled and inland towns west of here, the suffering and fatalities are greater than in any previous winter in years. Overland mail routes are blockaded and all communication is cut off by lines to this city from the West. All railroad traffic is impeded. In New York State, NEW YORK, February 13 The snowstorm yesterday and today was characterized at the office of the local weather bureau as the severest of its kind that has visited this city since the memorable blizzard of 1888.

From 39 to 40 were wrecked and from twelve to thirty people were drowned. Most of the boats were sloops and oyster schooners. Inundation of the lowlands of the Maryland, Delaware and Virginia peninsula caused great damage. On the eastern shore of Virginia people were obliged to live in the attics without fire or food, and in one region vessels were carried over 50 feet inland, where the receding tides have left them high and dry.","Toronto, Ont., March 14, Railway traffic is still much delayed by the snow blockade. The Ontario & Quebec and the Toronto, Grey and Bruce divisions of the Canadian Pacific Railway are completely closed and the Midland division of the Grand Trunk Railway is also at a standstill. Shoveling parties and snow plows have been sent out to clear the tracks and it is expected the roads will be open tomorrow. Many Vessels and Lives Lost, Philadelphia, March 14, Capt. Burns, of the brig Startle, which returned from the Delaware Capes today, tells the following story: ""We got here this morning after having a rough time of it. I believe that all the schooners that passed through the Capes since the beginning of the storm have been lost. The Startle and the brig Simpson were both anchored at their own pier at Lewis. The pier parted and the Simpson went down, we were saved. Owing to the high sea we could not go to the Simpson's assistance, and all were lost except the cook and the steward. The wife of the Captain was aboard and was lost."" Captain Burns continued: ""A large steamer, I think it was the Lord Olive, started to come in Monday."
"What specific impacts did the severe winter have on the infrastructure and agriculture in the areas mentioned, and how did these conditions affect human health, as demonstrated by the situation in the passage?","There were occasional snow flurries. But it was nothing compared with the backwardness that was to follow. On June 5, a severe cold front swept down from Hudson Bay to grip the St. Lawrence Valley for the next five days. Rain beginning in Quebec City on the 6th turned to snow as the thermometer plunged toward the freezing mark, and soon there was a foot on the ground. Drifts reached the axle trees of carriages, and some people began pressing their sleighs back into service. Snow squalls lashed Montreal. It was so cold in the city that standing water, it was said, froze to the thickness of a dollar coin—doubtless a Spanish or American coin, as Canadian dollars still didn't exist. In the countryside, sheep fresh from that spring's shearing couldn't take the cold and began to die off. Birds took shelter in houses or began falling dead in the fields. Fruit trees were nipped in the bud. Then, mercifully, the sun returned and hopes of a harvest, if a much reduced one, began to revive.","There were occasional snow flurries.

Every day the Winnipeg papers chronicle the arrival of one or more trains filled with these people. Besides this, there is already at hand the vanguard of what promises to be a large European immigration, the result of work done during the winter and former years.

On several occasions when the wind was light but the sky threatening, he was cautious and his judgment was controlled largely by the barometer, which was much of the time below 29 and seldom above 30, the normal height in the latitude traversed. The course made was a little more northerly than was thought safe, but fortunately no icebergs or field ice were observed. The number of persons on board the Coronet was twenty-nine, including sixteen sailors, five officers, the steward, cook, mess boy, and five guests. The history of the voyage contains nothing remarkable beyond the frequent references to heavy weather, which tested fully the sailing qualities of the Coronet. The Coronet people believe the Dauntless will be twenty-four to thirty hours late in arriving. Capt. Anderson says the weather was the worst he ever experienced in all his 174 Atlantic passages.

What specific impact did the snowstorm have on the Canada Atlantic train according to the passage?,"He charged that the present government were degrading public opinion, and that was only a natural result of an administration by a government, not only steeped in corruption, as its leader once said, but corruption incarnate. But he did not despair. The country's resources are great and there is sterling honesty and ability among the people to restore honest government yet. But he was not overconfident. It would take generations for the country to come right again, and that after a slow and painful struggle. He said the people of Canada had retrograded, and today public morality was painfully low and public opinion painfully weak. These were disagreeable truths to state, but it was the duty of the opposition to point them out, and he felt that the liberal party, though now defeated, was not beaten, and as in other countries would yet be triumphant at the polls. THE SNOWSTORM The delay to the train service stranded bound passengers. The snowstorm which began on Thursday evening and which did not abate until Saturday was one of the severest that has been witnessed in this part of the country for many a year.","Poullot, who was killed last fall by a tub of coal on board ship falling on him, has taken action against the owners of the vessel for $15,000. News has reached here of the death in Boston of Rev. Father Anderson, late of St. Patrick's Church here. Today's storm was the worst of the season, being in fact a blizzard. The snowfall is quite heavy. The electric railway contrived to keep its lines open and to operate them but only with great difficulty. Quite an avalanche fell from Cape Diamond into Champlain street completely blocking it but without doing any other damage. A large gang of men was set at work to dig out a new road. ON RAILROAD LINES Surprisingly Little Difficulty in the Handling of Trains. The storm, strange to say, did not to a great extent affect railway traffic. It appeared to have been confined to Eastern Ontario, Quebec, and a section of the Maritime Provinces. In conversation with passengers who happened to reach the city, there was some astonishment expressed at the blockade. The Canada Atlantic train which left the Capital at 8 o'clock yesterday morning was the first to strike a snag and it wasn't the beautiful either.","On the cross streets between St. Henri and Victoria square, passenger and vehicular traffic was simply impossible. In the early morning the good people started in to clear the track; it was a veritable case of love's labor lost. The snow fell; it was increasing. They gave it up in despair and resigned themselves to the inevitable. People floundered through the narrow margin of a sidewalk left for them to tread; they rushed in despair to the Street Railway track, only to fall in a heap on the snowy embankment on either side on the approach of a car, laboring under difficulties itself. There was no pleasure here, there or anywhere. There appeared to be nothing but snowflakes, which fell and whirled around in most fantastic shapes.

He detained him until the owner of the trunk came in, which he did at 6 o'clock, rather the worse for liquor. On his asking the new man what he was doing in his trunk, the only reply he got was a punch on the nose. A row ensued and the new man was mastered and Chief Detective Cullen sent for. On arrival they wanted the trunk riller to be arrested, but said they would not prosecute, so Cullen refused to make the arrest, the trunk's owner then settled matters by kicking the other man into the street. THE SNOWSTORM Again Demoralizes Railway Travel on Certain Routes A Slight Accident. With the exception of the Delaware & Hudson and Central Vermont trains, all incoming trains arrived nearly on time last night. The Delaware & Hudson is stuck between St. John and Rouse's Point. The Central Vermont is reported an hour and a half late. The Canada Atlantic ran off the track on the way in, and one of the cars was upset in a snowbank.","He heaped most of the blame on the wacky weather: ""It's an exceptional situation. You know, we have experienced the worst meteorological conditions ever - variations of 20 to 30 degrees. We had rain and then slush and then cold. We had 600 trucks on the streets,"" the mayor added. ""We're doing everything. It's a difficult situation, but we will pass through it."" Yves Pepin of the Montreal Urban Community Transit Corp. said many buses ran late yesterday but service stopped on only one line. Bus No. 11, which runs from Mount Royal metro station to the top of Ridgewood Ave., didn't run in the morning because the road over Mount Royal was too icy. Ron Rice, a professor of civil engineering and urban planning at McGill University, said Montreal would be better off with constant minus-40 cold than with this winter's wildly fluctuating temperatures - which are already causing pothole problems. In Saskatchewan, where winters are brutal, Rice said, all but the busiest thoroughfares are left snow-covered all winter. ""The colder it is, the less slippery the ice gets. It's intermediate temperatures between minus-5 and minus-15 Celsius that makes conditions dangerous for vehicles and pedestrians."
"What concerns do residents have about the health impacts of dumping dirty snow in vacant lots, as mentioned in the passage?","NOT TOLD OF PLANS Last week, Montreal officials complained they hadn't been told of Outremont's plans to dump snow on the Beaubien property. Pierre-Yves Melancon of Montreal's executive committee insisted local zoning doesn't allow for that type of waste storage. Outremont leased the CP site last winter to cope with the overflow of ice and snow last winter without advising Montreal. But Melancon said that wouldn't be a practical permanent solution, since it would have an impact on Montreal's sewage system. However, opposition councillor Helen Fotopulos can't help wondering why Outremont is ready to forge ahead with the sale if Montreal won't agree to let it use the site as planned. ""Once again, they are treating us with contempt, like a Third World neighbourhood where they can dump their garbage,"" Fotopulos, who represents Mile End, can't help remembering last summer's crisis, when the city allowed a rock-crushing quarry to set up shop in the same area, a stone's throw from the schoolyard at Edouard VII - and the same site where the snow is supposed to be dumped. Residents on both sides of the municipal boundary object to the plan, citing environmental concerns and the fact they weren't informed.","To this protest, it may be replied that, if the estimate of total cost and its distribution among the householders be honestly made, the quotas that even the largest proprietors or first-class householders would have to pay would be materially less than the expenses that they unavoidably incur at present; while for the humbler class of tenants, the proportional charge would be insignificant. It is really a simple sum in arithmetic. The advantages to be derived from the new departure are obvious. Our streets will be more attractive, locomotion will be unattended with discomfort and danger, as at present; the workingmen will gain by the need of employing a regular staff of laborers; poor and rich will alike profit by the additional security; the tale of fatal or serious accidents will be diminished; the business community will gain considerably; snow barricades interfering with traffic will be among the things of the past; strangers will no longer wish they had not come, and natives and aliens will be saved those trials of temper, which, oft repeated, are inimical to health. The care of the streets in winter can hardly be separated from the spring overhauling, the prompt and efficient discharge of which is essential to our well-being.","?000rTt, 12 mo 0000T warr 694-lbtO TOYOTA Supra Turbo 1988 JANUARY 7 1993 TU mum vor a Cy needs cash to halt snow-dumping in river 15-million 'slush' fun GRAEME HAMILTON THE GAZETTE Almost one-third of the snow cleared from Montreal streets is still dumped straight into the St Lawrence River, and city officials can't guarantee they can scrape together the $15 million needed to meet the province's 1996 deadline to halt river dumping. Five years ago, Quebec announced it would require municipalities to stop using waterways as sewers for snow and slush. Studies had found that snow cleared from roads and sidewalks was loaded with salt, oil, heavy metals and even full garbage bags. It makes no sense to let cities continue dumping polluted snow into rivers, Quebec Environment Department spokesman Didier Bicchi said in an interview yesterday. Quebec has spent $6.5 billion to clean up water quality, we've taken steps to protect the shoreline. It would be aberrant to continue allowing the dumping of contaminants into the water, he said."
How did the flood specifically affect the operations at the Custom House and the transportation methods used by the clerks to exit the building?,"On Queen Street Ives' foundry was found to be flooded and all work stopped, as was the case in the St. Lawrence Sugar Refinery. In the latter there will be very little damage, as the precaution had been taken to remove the barrels of sugar beyond the reach of the water. In Grey Nun Street the cellars of A. W. Tester & Co. were flooded, as was the wallpaper factory of John C. Watson. In the latter, Mr. Winter, the engineer, with commendable foresight, had kept the engine working to the last minute, and by removing most of the perishable goods to a place of safety, a piece of prudence on his part which will no doubt be duly appreciated. On Foundling Street barrels, straw and pieces of wood were huddled together floating about; while on the steps of several of the stores were clerks, anxiously awaiting for a boat to take them safely to town. There were about three feet of water on St. Paul Street, as far as the Custom House Square.","CALL ON THE NEW ENGLAND COAST, Boston, January 10 Reports continue to come in from all points along the coast, which show that the storm of last night worked sad havoc among the shipping. Many vessels were driven ashore, and nearly all had their rigging damaged. ALL NIGHT ON A FROZEN BOAT, New York, January 10 The Staten Island ferry boat Westfield on her midnight trip from New York for the fast shore landing had a terrible time. Nearly all the passengers had to remain on board all night and were landed at Clifton at 8 o'clock this morning. A SERIOUS FLOOD, Griffintown and Point St. Charles Partially inundated. The river has risen four feet, and the flood has now attained serious dimensions. The rise has been gradual, the only jump being at 3 o'clock when the water rose ten inches at a time. At 3 o'clock it was within one foot of the top of the revetment wall, and suddenly it rose over it and flooded Commissioner Street. The second rise, at 7 o'clock, completed the work, and the water rose several inches up the buildings on the other side of the street.","The craft was named the Tourmaline, but it is needless to say did not resemble the gallant frigate of that name which once honored Montreal with its presence. Passing the Albion and Western Hotels, which were partially submerged, the imprisoned guests and employees gazing blandly on the lively scene outside, as all sorts of craft were thronging the turbid waters. Sulling down Collège street, it was noticed that there was about six feet of water in the cellars of Messrs. W. Tester & Co., were flooded, as was the wall paper factory of John C. Watson, in the latter, Mr. Winter, the engineer, with commendable foresight, had kept the last minute, and by means of the elevator had removed most of the perishable goods to a place of safety, a piece of prudence on his part which will no doubt be duly appreciated. On Foundling street barrels, straw and pieces of wood were huddled together floating about; while on the steps of several of the stores were clerks, anxiously awaiting for a boat to take them safely to town. There were about three feet of water on St. Paul street, as far as the Custom House square."
How did the flooding impact the operations and infrastructure of the police and fire stations in the affected area?,"In the vicinity and along Craig Street there are many stores partially filled with water. IN GRIFFINTOWN matters are in a much worse condition. The water rose rapidly in the cellars, in many cases burying from sight the poor people's supply of fuel for the winter. In a short time the water made its appearance on the streets, and many of them were several inches under water. The worst part was between Ann and McCord streets. The streets were not wholly covered, but there was enough water to put an almost complete stop to traffic. In some streets the water lay about a foot deep, covering up the sidewalks, in others it only lay in the roadway, and in others one side would be submerged, while the other would be quite passable. In many other places, however, although the water did not show it had melted the snow, and through this slush people had to pick their way, for the carters would not drive through it. The police station in Young Street is surrounded by a pool of water about a foot deep. The rubber boots which were used during last year's flood were again served out to the police yesterday, but how they are to get around, not to speak of helping citizens, remains to be seen.","The foot of McGill Street is also covered with water. At Messrs. Greenshields, Sons & Co.'s, Victoria Square, they were busy at work yesterday removing goods from the basement. In the vicinity and along Craig Street there are many stores partially filled with water. IN GRIMNTOWN matters are in a much worse condition.

The police station in Young Street is surrounded by a pool of water about a foot deep.",CALM. Quiet reigned supreme in Point St. Charles yesterday. In the morning boats were in great demand to take people to church and during the day some of the young people went out for a row but the great majority of the population remained at home. One or two saloons were doing a running business with very little pretence at concealment but only two cases of drunkenness were noticed on the streets. The water varies in depth from a few inches to three feet. A boat cannot proceed very far in any direction on account of the shallow water and obstructions. Manufacturers street and the other blocks in the immediate vicinity of the canal are perfectly dry but the water reaches up Shearer street near the corner of Richardson. On this street there is nearly two feet of water and the lumber in the various yards is floating. In Centre street there are two and a half feet in some places tapering away to about six inches in others. The water has not entered the fire station but as a matter of precaution the horses and engine have been removed to Seigneurs street. A flat bottomed boat is moored opposite the station loaded with hose Babcocks and all the requisites for extinguishing fires.
"How did the flood, caused by the breaking-up of ice above the Lachine Rapids, specifically impact the infrastructure and human activities at the Point police station and the fire station on Centre Street?","The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water.","Another, who had acquired considerable experience and dexterity in former floods, had been able to rake up a considerable amount of coal by a sort of grapnel of his own contrivance. An old man standing near said, with a quiet chuckle, that as soon as he heard the water was rising he removed his coal from the cellar and put it where it would do more good. This was the only case our reporter heard of where people had had the foresight to adopt this precaution, the great majority of the people having simply sat down and waited for the inevitable result which comes regularly once or twice a year. IN POINT ST. CHARLES the flood bids fair to be about as serious as the last, and already the streets are totally flooded from St. Patrick Street as far as the eye can see. The people are in the greatest consternation, as they will have the greatest difficulty in getting to their work in the morning. The water is said to extend as far as Centre Street, and to be in some places about two and a half feet deep. At the police station the water is unusually high, and is four or five feet deep in the cellar.","Mr. Patton managed to keep his friend above water until assistance arrived, but in doing so he drove his hand through the window of a house and the broken glass nearly severed the fingers from his right hand. Mr. Shearer's house, at the foot of the Seigneurs street bridge, is completely flooded, while in the front garden there is enough water to float boats. On Centre street, the water is eight feet deep, and the damage to the property owners and storekeepers is incalculable, as the greater part of their goods were not removed, no one thinking that the flood would prove so disastrous. All the cattle sheds, fencing, and sidewalks at the Point have been swept away, while a large number of livestock have been drowned. The house of Conductor Millar on Centre street is completely submerged and the damage to his furniture alone will amount upwards of $500. The water at the Wellington street bridge is about five feet deep, while there is over a foot of water on the main floor of the police station which is on high ground. All the Grand Trunk trains for the East had to be cancelled."
"What specific infrastructural damage was caused by the moving ice and accompanying flood in the area between Vaudreuil and St. Johns, and how does this compare to the flood of 1861 in terms of economic and ecological impact according to the passage?","At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water. There were of course many incidents, some of them laughable, some of them sad, connected with the flood. Men and boys constructed rafts and paddled round on them; express wagons were in use as ferries and conveyed loads of waiting people, men and women, to their homes, not a few of which were partly under water. Large crowds of people collected in the affected districts and stood in groups watching the water as it slowly crept up, bearing with it blocks of ice, which stranded on the street as it would ebb for a short time, only to return with greater volume within a comparatively short period. The chief cause of the flood was doubtless the breaking-up of the ice in the reaches above the Lachine Rapids. At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore.","In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level.

I would mention that where the ice had stayed all winter there were twelve fathoms of water. Then you think the cause of the ice jamming is because it rests on the bottom? Yes, to a certain extent. Of course islands and narrows assist, but the ice is jammed completely together to a depth of ten, twenty or thirty feet, according to the depth of the river. In 1861 I was going down on a schooner three or four days after the river was open and from Lavaltrie island down to Lachine all the north shore was littered with ice. What kept the ice there? Not waves or bounds. It rested on the bottom of the river. What is the best means of preventing the floods? There is only one way, and that is to keep Lake St. Peter clear by means of steamers specially built with heavy elevated bows."
"What specific areas in the city have been newly affected by the floodwaters, and how has this impacted the infrastructure such as streets and cellars?","In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected.

On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George. In order to reach the western end of the lower portion of the city a detour had to be made by way of Palace Street to Cathedral, as the water covered St. Antoine to past Ste.

Quite a number of men were seen with rubber boots up to their thighs trudging through the water, rather than pay fifty cents for a seat of 200 or 300 feet. But in St. Paul Street and the adjacent districts the water was far too deep for pedestrianism.","The residents on the south shore were fortunately warned in time by telephone, and they were not slow to act on the advice, for early yesterday morning all the furniture that could be handled easily was removed to a safe distance. At Maisonneuve and Hochelega there was a slight move of the ice, with the result that the water rose very suddenly, flooding the Jidda and barns near the river front. For some days past the inhabitants have been expecting a flood, and the city expressmen have done thriving business in transferring the goods and chattels to places out of reach of the water. The occupants in many cases shifted the cooking stove to the upper part of the house, and what were formerly bedrooms have been for the past few days transformed into kitchens and dining rooms. While the houses have been inundated, the occupants have found great difficulty in getting to their work at the sugar works and cotton mills. Some of the old-timers improvised a raft and after a little hard and somewhat perilous steering managed to reach terra firma. Others who had high rubber boots waded through the water, but the feminine portion of the community, rather than take the chance of an accident, preferred to stop at home until the water recedes.","It appears that certain parties are routing out vacant lots owned by them as public dumps, and in those is dumped all the dirty snow taken from yards, the owner of the lot receiving as compensation about two cents a load.

About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city.

It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled.

"How did the flooding impact transportation and access routes in the city, specifically regarding the need for detours and alternative means of crossing flooded areas?","EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED DISTRICT. At 11 o'clock the water extended up St. Urbain Street, about fifty yards above Craig Street and from Craig up Alexander Street to Vitre, remaining the same; on Cote Street it was up to the Theatre Royal, and rose as high as the hubs of carriage wheels on Vitre, between St. George and Chenneville. On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George. In order to reach the western end of the lower portion of the city a detour had to be made by way of Palace Street to Cathedral, as the water covered St. Antoine to past Ste. Montpie, and fully flooded St. David's Lane. Driving along St. Antoine the stretch of water covering St. James West and the railway was clearly visible on passing every side street, and it was not till Fillfold Street was reached that a passage to Notre Dame Street West could be effected.","During the past twenty-four hours there have been two slight shoves in the harbor, which proved of some little benefit at Hochelaga, for it forced the ice in the ship channel. The residents on the south shore were fortunately warned in time by telephone, and they were not slow to act on the advice, for early yesterday morning all the furniture that could be handled easily was removed to a safe distance. At Maisonneuve and Hochelaga there was a slight move of the ice, with the result that the water rose very suddenly, flooding the Jidda and barns near the river front. For some days past the inhabitants have been expecting a flood, and the city expressmen have done thriving business in transferring the goods and chattels to places out of reach of the water. The occupants in many cases shifted the cooking stove to the upper part of the house, and what were formerly bedrooms have been for the past few days transformed into kitchens and dining rooms. While the houses have been inundated, the occupants have found great difficulty in getting to their work in the sugar works and cotton mills. Some of the old-timers improvised a raft and after a little hard and somewhat perilous steering managed to reach terra firma.","The residents on the south shore were fortunately warned in time by telephone, and they were not slow to act on the advice, for early yesterday morning all the furniture that could be handled easily was removed to a safe distance.

From Other Points, High Water General One, Covering a Wide Extent of Country, Advices from points in all parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland report high water and freshets in the streams. At Harpers Ferry, W. Va, the rivers on Saturday were within two feet of being as high as in 1877 and still rising. The water in Shenandoah Street was 8 to 10 feet deep. Much damage was done at Lynchburg, Va. The James River at this point is twenty-five feet above ordinary tide, and all communication is cut off on the Richmond and Allegheny road. At Baltimore on Friday night the Potomac jumped its banks and many of the telegraph stations had to be abandoned, as the water covered the tables. Some of the operators sent their telegrams to the dispatcher’s office standing or sitting in water up to their waists. The stage of water in the Alleghany River at Pittsburgh became so alarming on Saturday that residents living in low lying districts began to remove their household effects to a higher level.

Passing the Amion and Western Hotels, which were partially submerged, the imprisoned guests and employees gazed blandly on the lively scene outside, as all sorts of craft were thronging the turbid waters. Sailing down Collere street, it was noticed that there was about six feet of water in the cellars of Messrs. H. & I. Ieveridge & Co., and that the door of the office of the ashes inspector was halfway under water. On St. Henry street there was still four feet of snow, and Mr. Chaffee, the proprietor of Lowe's hotel, had utilized this as a roadway to his house, by placing a large plank into the doorway. Here there are five feet of water in the cellar. All the houses on College street were partially submerged, and the hay market presented the spectacle of a large lake, the weigh house looking like an island in the center."
"How has the flood impacted the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sectors, specifically regarding the situation at the Grand Trunk office and the fate of livestock?","A room was impassable to foot passengers, and sundry express wagons, owned by enterprising drivers, ferried people across at the moderate sum of five cents per head. From halfway between Craig and Vitre, on Bleury Street, wagons were employed in transporting passengers to the higher ground on St. Peter, while a number of people were floating on improvised rafts, made from portions of sidewalks, on all the streets east from Victoria Square to Cote. At the corner of the latter and Craig incidents were numerous, some of which resulted in many people getting wet. Several photographers were observed taking views of the flooded streets. At night numerous boats flitted along St. Antoine, Bonaventure, McGill and other streets. AT POINT ST. CHARLES the suffering must be most severe. The water has risen to a height fully two feet higher than during the inundation last May. The wind is strong. At the Grand Trunk office the water came up to the desk at the innermost end. The works are, of course, stopped, only by last accounts communication is kept up. Several horses are known to have been drowned, and no doubt not a few cows have met like fate.

Yesterday morning, the inhabitants of ST. LAURENTVILLE never expected to be flooded, but by ten o'clock the water had risen about a foot high in the lower parts of the suburb, and by noon the whole village was inundated. The sidewalks are floating about the streets, and those who dwelt in the lower parts of tenements have had to remove all their goods and chattels to higher quarters. Business is entirely suspended and the shops closed. Horses and cattle have had to be removed from their stables, and several animals may not recover from the effects. The Grand Trunk shops are completely flooded except the blacksmith's shop, but should the water rise very much higher, business will also have to be suspended there. The depth of the water in the streets at noon was from 5 to 8 feet. Many nervous people have received a great shock by the sudden flooding of their houses. Cunegonde also suffered considerably, but the main flow of the flood seems to have been cut off from it by the Lachine canal."

St. Louis, May 14, The river at this point reached a height of 32.8 feet this afternoon, which is only sixteen inches below the big flood of 1883, and a rise of about a foot since last night. As the water rises more and more land in the northern and southern parts of the city become submerged and hourly encroachments are made on the railroad tracks and other property bordering on the river. More land is inundated on the eastern side of the river, and nearly all the ground on the south side of East St. Louis to east Carondelet, a distance of about five miles, is under water. The large section of the country north of East St. Louis, reaching up to the national stock yards, is also submerged.","Can Get Their Tobacco, New York, May 25.

Nearly all the passengers had to remain on board all night and were landed at Clifton at 8 o'clock this morning. A SERIOUS FLOOD, Griffintown and Point St. Charles Partially inundated. The river has risen four feet, and the flood has now attained serious dimensions. The rise has been gradual, the only jump being at 3 o'clock when the water rose ten inches at a time. At 3 o'clock it was within one foot of the top of the revetment wall, and suddenly it rose over it and flooded Commissioner Street. The second rise, at 7 o'clock, completed the work, and the water rose several inches up the buildings on the other side of the street.","THE RISING OF THE WATERS, Morion Flooding Affects Belleville, HALF THE CITY UNDER WATER, Grant Miller's Report from the Flooded Area, Belleville, February 4 Bad as was the situation in the flooded district yesterday, it has altered materially for the worse within the last few hours.

K. Ward, President St. George's Society, Baron De Lorme, Mr. Mesquelier, Mr. Dolftis, and representatives from the several city papers. The Mayor gave the toast of ""The Queen,"" which was right loyally received, followed by ""Our Volunteers."" In proposing this toast his worship referred to the alacrity with which the call to put down the rebellion in the Northwest had been responded to. He paid a glowing eulogy to the work they were doing for Canada, and expressed the hope that we would shortly be permitted to welcome them back to our midst with the welcome due to those who had done their duty faithfully and well. Col. Stevenson responded in a neat speech, in which he referred to some of the calumnies that had been spread in regard to our own regiment, expressed his conviction that they would turn out to be without a shadow of truth. The Mayor next gave France and our other friends, represented by their consuls and other friends, due and appropriate replies.","Fresh dangers were added by some of the streets being littered with carts and other vehicles whose horses were caught in the first rush of the flood and had to be cut loose. The wagons were left to their fate, and where the water was shallow were only a few inches below the surface. Other impediments to safe navigation were fences, which though hid from sight were near enough to the surface to make things decidedly unpleasant. The streets were crowded with boats and rafts of every description, and the happy possessor of a trim boat was as much in demand among the young ladies of the Point as the young man was who owned a toboggan a month ago, or as the average volunteer in uniform is at any time. On arriving at the police station the reason for the dearth of boats was made apparent, for no less than nine were tied to the door while a squad of policemen were hanging around smoking the pipe of peace. It was said that these men had been on duty almost incessantly since the beginning of the flood, but it did seem strange that these men should be loafing about with the boats at hand, while the extra police, whom the chief had sent down, were standing at the Wellington bridge waiting for something to do.","The scheme was dropped as of no use, and the chairman of the inundation committee got home again. NOW THE RIVER. Saturday night's advices from down river ports were that at Three Rivers the lake ice was on the move since 2 p.m. Lachine reported a slight shove accompanied by a rise, and then a fall in the water. At Berthierville the ice was rotten and it was hoped the river would be clear by today. Looking down the river from Montreal at dusk no sign of a break-up was apparent; as far as the eye could reach was one stretch of rugged ice pack, unbroken except in one or two very small patches. Over towards St. Lambert the same view presented itself, the only extent of water visible being where Commissioners Street was five feet under water. Here the current swept along at the rate of four or five miles an hour.

What infrastructure and political challenges are being addressed in Montreal and New Edinburgh as a result of the ice conditions and how are they being managed according to the passage?,"Caille saluted the exceptional co-operation from his clients, saying most downtown businesses followed their instructions to the letter. The shortened workday made for a grisly rush hour, however, as almost everyone left for home at the same time. People have started going out a little earlier because the shops and everything are closed at 4 o'clock, and the thing is, there's quite a lot of crews around, said Transport Quebec spokesman Maria Soteriades. Traffic on off-island bridges rolled slowly, most highways were jammed, and some major city streets - many still narrowed by banks of rock-hard frozen snow - were so clogged it took 10 or 15 minutes to travel a block at the peak of the early rush. Some downtown blocks remained barricaded because of concerns about falling ice, and Old Montreal remained closed to traffic. At one point, one traffic jam stretched back from the clogged Champlain Bridge, up the Bonaventure expressway and University St. The Viger tunnel on the Ville-Marie expressway was closed for an hour because transport officials worried drivers might suffer carbon-monoxide poisoning during the gridlock.","I could wish it were more moderately, but no man can go about the uncasing of this grand imposture, without, like Milton, ""feeling himself enwrapped on the sudden in those images and labyrinths of dreadful and hideous thought.""

For centuries the hub of a fabled maritime empire that rivaled the leading cities of the world, a diminished Venice today has lost half its population and relies on strangers for survival.

Business has not benefited thereby; quite the contrary. Our country markets have been filling up with cattle and sheep in anticipation of the Christmas demand, while the usual attractive shows and sales of Christmas fat stock have kept many buyers away from Birkenhead, who will, however, probably find their way back after the festive season is over. While the country demand has thus been cut off to a considerable extent, our London customers have been buying pretty strong, the supplies at Deptford for the past ten days having been below the average. The worst of this London trade, however, is they want to buy all our choice beef, and when they get served, there is some difficulty in selling out the secondary and third class bodies left.

Every officer, he says, knows the facts to be as alleged. Denial is useless. The only alternative to still more ruinous degeneracy is to set about immediate and vigorous reform. Seven years ago a cry was raised against the navy; it was pooh-poohed and dropped; the evils complained of continued till they became glaringly obvious. Then a crisis was reached, the needed reforms were begun (though not a day too soon) and the reputation of England's naval service was saved. The inference is obvious.

Mundella, president of the Board of Trade, was summoned in the Court of Queen's Bench today as one of the directors of the defunct New Zealand Land Company. The courtroom was crowded. Mr. Mundella said he resigned from the board of directors of the New Zealand Land Company when he was appointed to his present office in the Cabinet in 1892. At that time he owned 650 shares of the company's stock, which he subsequently sold. Mr. Mundella denied that he had ever assented to the issuance of any misleading prospectus, but he admitted that he had given his assent to the declaration of a dividend although the fiscal officers of the company had expected a deficit of 347,000. He gave his assent because he had the best possible assurance that the company could meet the deficit, pay its debts and would ultimately prove a success. He testified that he had also agreed to a proposal that the company lend Mr. Thomas Russell, a director, 40,000 in spite of the fact that the company was then earning nothing and burdened with a debt of 200,000. He was rushed into the matter without having time for consideration."

"What measures did the city's emergency-measures committee implement to address the safety risks posed by the ice storm in Mount Royal Park and the other 715 parks, and how effective were these measures in preventing public access?","Parks department superintendent Jean-Jacques Linscourt estimated yesterday that a quarter of the trees in Mount Royal Park might have to be cut down because of the terrible damage caused by this week's ice storm. COULD LOSE ONE-QUARTER ""A visual estimation leads us to believe that we could lose 25 percent of the trees in Mount Royal Park,"" parks department spokesman Edith Pariseau said, adding that the cost of the damage has yet to be tallied. She said the estimate was very rough and that parks officials were so busy dealing with emergencies yesterday that they could not take accurate stock of damage on the mountain. Mount Royal is a symbol of Montreal and one of its tourism jewels, with more than 3 million visitors a year. That kind of traffic, many of whom are skiers, mountain-bikers and hikers, makes the park's natural forest vulnerable at any time.

Jamie Muir, the minister responsible for emergency measures, took a first-hand look yesterday at some of the areas hardest hit when a month's worth of rain soaked the island last week. After a tour that included collapsed culverts on the outskirts of Sydney, a heavily damaged basement in the town of Dominion, and a swamped store in Glace Bay, the minister said it will take days to place a dollar figure on the damage. ""We've seen damage in all areas,"" said Muir, a Truro resident who experienced the massive flooding that took place there a few years ago.

How do the flood-relief compensation approaches of Quebec and Ontario reflect their differing political philosophies and impact taxpayers according to the passage?,"But hopefully the water won't Flood-relief schemes differ among provinces TAXPAYERS BEAR FINANCIAL BURDEN Quebec offers $100,000 maximum; Ontario doubles funds raised by committee Residential property owners can't buy flood insurance in Quebec—or in most of North America, for that matter. But they can, and do, apply for government financial aid after floods—and no more so in Canada than in Quebec, where the provincial compensation plan is worth as much as $100,000. The kind of flood-relief compensation provincial governments offer residential property owners varies widely. But the comparison of Quebec with Ontario is interesting for what it says about political philosophies in the two provinces—and the bottom line for taxpayers.","They generally cost about $50. The difference between water damage caused by sewer backup and water damage caused by floods isn't always clear, Chadirdjian said. Sometimes, people who live blocks away from a shoreline where there has been flooding will have sewer backup without any evidence of invading surface floodwater.

But many environmentalists said the current floods could cause more damage than has been suffered for several decades. The Yangtze delta was likely to become even more vulnerable to floods because of environmental changes in the river basin and lack of investment in barriers to contain the river, they said. Government-backed logging programs in eastern Tibet in recent years are said to have exacerbated flooding resulting from deforestation. Heavy rain since Easter has quickly washed through into the river. Water is reaching the river faster and moving quicker downstream. The Yangtze's carrying capacity is diminishing rapidly because of a buildup of silt on the riverbed. As peasants clear land covered by scrub and trees to plant cash crops, they fail to replace the root system that holds the soil in place. Erosion is inevitable."
"What unique financial aid measures did Premier Lucien Bouchard announce for flood victims, and how might these measures differ for medium-sized firms compared to small businesses?","While Jonquiere residents began returning to their homes, about 150 residents of the North Shore community of Forestville were evacuated because authorities were concerned that a wooden dam might give way under the continued pressure of tonnes of water pushing up against it, said Lavallee. Throughout the North Shore, Charlevoix and Saguenay-Lac St.-Jean regions, road crews were busy trying to reopen highways closed after sections of roadway or bridges were washed away by the floods. However, it will be days before all the highways are open again. Hydro-Quebec crews were also busy trying to re-establish power to an estimated 8,000 subscribers. Late yesterday, the government's emergency co-ordination centre was one of those customers, with officials briefing reporters by cellular phone. Officials were also busy yesterday setting up a system to distribute the $2,500 advances to flood victims under a program announced by Premier Lucien Bouchard Monday night.

""It would be hard to get more accurate predictions than what we had.""","""We are very, very proud of the work that we did,"" said Pierre Ducharme, head of meteorology at Environment Canada's Montreal office. ""It would be hard to get more accurate predictions than what we had."" The agency reviewed its weekend procedures to see how it handled predicting the heavy rainfall that battered the Saguenay area. The Montreal office has a severe-weather team that watches for heavy rains, tornados and other extreme weather conditions. It sent out a first warning of heavy rain at 2:10 p.m. Thursday, saying there could be accumulations of more than 50 mm of rain. A second warning was issued on Friday. ""The warnings we sent out almost perfectly match the areas hit by heavy rainfall,"" Ducharme said. But Environment Canada didn't warn anyone about flooding because ""that's not our job,"" he said. ""Once we predict heavy rains, it's up to the dam-owner or a homeowner to make sure they can deal with it."" The weather warnings were immediately sent to provincial civil-protection authorities, made available to media outlets and put on several other Environment Canada communication networks, including a radio service and weather-information phone lines, and a fax-like network that provides information to municipal authorities."
"How did the flooding and increased water levels in Sturgeon Creek impact the safety and infrastructure in the Winnipeg suburb, as illustrated by the incident involving Shahid Husain?","Week-long rains in late July flooded basements and streets throughout the city and led to one death. Rivers and streams to the north and west of Winnipeg are expected to crest later this week, but no serious flooding is expected, Alf Warkentein of the Manitoba water-resources branch said yesterday. The only homeowners who probably need to worry are those in low-lying areas near rivers or streams, he added. In outlying parts of Winnipeg Sunday, basements flooded and power lines went down as up to 7.5 centimetres of rain fell. Two railway underpasses were closed, snarling traffic as people made the Sunday-night trek home from cottage country after a balmy weekend. Streets inside Winnipeg were littered with stalled cars that failed to make it through flooded streets. Yesterday dawned with sunny, cloudless skies over southern Manitoba, but Warkentein said many streams to the west and north of Winnipeg had already spilled their banks, leaving pools of water in nearby fields. Inside Winnipeg, Sturgeon Creek, normally a shallow stream in the western part of the city, remained a swift-flowing river that claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy during a month's flooding.","Street people get the Outrider free and can keep the money they get for each copy, Mackin said.

"What specific infrastructure impacts were reported in Montreal due to the storm, as mentioned in the passage?","The images of destruction were flashed around the world. Power outages lasted up to nine days in Montreal and up to 33 days on the South Shore, in an area that became known as the Dark Triangle. At its peak, half the Quebec population - 3 million people - had no power. Thirty deaths were attributed to the ice storm, the 1,500-page Nicolet Commission report on the disaster, released in April 1999, said. Causes included house fires, hypothermia, and carbon-monoxide poisoning from generators and propane-gas stoves used indoors. Hundreds of people filled hospital emergency wards with fractures after falling on icy streets. The disaster wreaked an estimated $3 billion in destruction, the Nicolet Commission found. ""We've never had five days in a row of freezing precipitation,"" Environment Canada weather forecaster Gilbert Fillion said. Roads were blocked by branches and downed power lines. Sheets of ice fell from buildings. The bridges between Montreal Island and the South Shore were closed at one point. The metro system shut down temporarily. Montreal's main water filtration plants lost power, threatening the island's water supply. East-end oil refineries also lost power for a spell.

As power woes worsened, there was one glimmer of hope: the system of winter storms that has dumped 85 to 105 millimeters of freezing rain, ice and snow since Monday has finally moved on. Environment Canada is calling for partly cloudy skies in the Montreal area today, with a 40-percent chance of light flurries and a high near zero. Overnight lows are predicted to be minus 8 to minus 10C. Yesterday's storm, which dumped 10 to 20 millimeters of rain, freezing rain and ice pellets on Montreal and the South Shore, pushed the region's already frayed infrastructure to the breaking point. Eastern Ontario, the Maritime and parts of the northeastern US also have been hit hard. More than 30 hydro towers fell during the night and early morning around the city, and transmission lines from the Beauharnois and Les Cedres generating stations and several substations were knocked out.","And while all of the above might have seemed a fair price to pay for a day without a humidex, Environment Canada is predicting that this weekend's comparatively moderate temperatures will give way to more hot, sticky weather beginning Monday. The McGill measuring station (in downtown Montreal) recorded 42 millimetres of rain over the first hour of the storm, said Environment Canada meteorologist Andre Cantin, noting the stations in Dorval and the city's east end recorded 31 mm during the same period. ""We'll get some relief from the heat wave today and tomorrow,"" But with the start of the week, we're back to looking at temperatures above normal, and by Thursday and Friday, we'll probably be looking at humidex factors of about 40 degrees. While yesterday's rainfall was sufficiently intense to overload Montreal's aging sewer system, it was the high winds packed by the storm system, three cells of which collided with Montreal between 1 and 4 p.m., that did the most widespread damage. Gusts of up to 80 kilometres per hour were reported, sufficient to rip branches off trees and down power lines, at one point leaving 14,000 of Hydro-Québec's Montreal area customers without power."

She said it's impossible to predict which neighbourhoods will have their power restored next, and asked customers to be patient. Crocepti explained that the utility's repair plan for widespread blackouts is based on client need and the type of equipment that has been damaged, not geography. ""The idea is to re-establish service to as many people as possible with the fewest number of repairs."" The daytime temperature is expected to hover just below zero and the weather office is calling for winds gusting up to 40 kilometres per hour. The freezing rain, coupled with winds strong enough to break tree limbs already laden with the 20 mm of ice that fell earlier in the week, had experts predicting the worst.

Missouri Governor Matt Blunt declared a state of emergency and Close to 469 missing or dead in Philippines ASSOCIATED PRESS CUINOBATAN, PHILIPPINES - The ash and boulders had been building up since an eruption in July high on the slopes of the Mayon volcano. Typhoon Durian's blasts of wind and drenching rain raked it all down in a deadly black wall of debris. For nearly three hours Thursday afternoon, mudslides ripped through Mayon's gullies, uprooting trees, flattening houses and engulfing people.","In Chicago, where snow covered street signs and commuters walked gingerly along slushy streets, forecasters warned residents to be careful digging out of what they called ""heart attack snow"" - difficult to shovel because it is so heavy. ""My daughter had to help my husband dig out the yard so he wouldn't have a heart attack,"" Judy Siddiqui said. Chicago received 15.7 centimetres of snow. At least 208 people were killed - most in mudslides on Mayon - and 261 were missing, the national Office of Civil Defence reported. Another 82 were injured. With power and phone lines down, it took until yesterday morning, when the first flights managed to survey the area, for the scope of the devastation to emerge. ""The disaster covered almost every corner of this province - rampaging floods, falling trees, damaged houses,"" said Fernando Gonzalez, governor of Albay province, the site of most deaths. Mayon, a popular tourist destination, is one of the Philippines' 22 active volcanoes. It erupted in July, depositing millions of tons of rocks and volcanic ash on its slopes, and has continued to rumble since then. Rains from succeeding typhoons may have loosened the materials.","In Chicago, where snow covered street signs and commuters walked gingerly along slushy streets, forecasters warned residents to be careful digging out of what they called ""heart attack snow"" - difficult to shovel because it is so heavy.

The two countries where starvation has been common for more than a decade, Mozambique and Angola, have had good rains and good crops.

The United Nations estimates 500,000 people face starvation in Mozambique's central provinces. Charles Bassett, the Canadian high commissioner in Zimbabwe, said Thursday that people are already dying in Zimbabwe as a result of malnutrition. And the worst is yet to come. The dry season is at its peak in July and August and the already critical water shortage will become dire, Bassett said. Already there are many communities that are 40 kilometres from the nearest water. It is going to be a massive task to take water to isolated communities, he said. The Zimbabwe government has a $40-million plan to buy 600 water tankers and to drill 2,600 holes but it's uncertain the plan can be activated quickly enough.

To raise awareness and funds for the Quebec chapter of the Easter Seal Foundation of Canada and its work with disabled children. As with any event of this sort, planning is everything. The logistics of transport, safety, food, rest, injuries, and communications must carefully be accounted for. What could not be accounted for was the extreme hot weather and each member's particular response to it. As the participants experienced, running in 30-degree heat with a relative humidity of 80 per cent is a sure way of inflicting upon oneself a mild to severe heat injury. Every year, we cold-footed northerners are struck - unprepared - by a couple of heat waves and then shocked to learn about the deaths they can cause. The risk of developing a heat illness increases if one exercises or has inadequate water intake. The very young, whose sweat glands are not fully developed, and the elderly are most at risk. Individuals who have consumed alcohol (a diuretic) or drugs with similar effects should be particularly vigilant. There are two types of heat illness: heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Though heat exhaustion is the less severe, if left untreated, it can lead to a heat stroke.","As branches toppled, lines would automatically shut off power to protect the system, he explained.

United States journals, who in ridicule of the claims that the Canadian Northwest is less subject to the visits of the boreal blizzard than their own territories, declared that Winnipeg was the center of the ""banana belt"" of the continent, may read with profit the reports of the climatic condition that now prevail in the two regions. While in Minnesota, Dakota and Nebraska the railways are blocked with snow and occasionally at intervals with stalled and broken engines, along the line of the Canadian Pacific the trains are running on time, the weather is calm and fine, and the temperature from Winnipeg westward varies from 15 to 4 above zero. Bananas may not ripen to perfection north of the 49th parallel, but they will evidently do better than on the snowy wastes of Kansas and Dakota, the settlers on whose lands, harassed in winter by the blizzard, in summer by the cyclone, in harvest time by the red-legged grasshopper and at all times by the railway and elevator monopoly, could not do better than move up out of the cold to the more than equally fertile and less exposed Canadian territories where a cyclone cellar is a thing unknown and warm toes can be kept in everybody's boots."

Point Pleasant City, N","THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1997 WORLD Western states dig out B8 Associated Press DENVER - Rescuers used helicopters, snowmobiles and military vehicles yesterday to pick up snowbound travellers and residents left without heat by a record blizzard in the western United States that piled snowdrifts up to 4.5 metres high. About eight people were unaccounted for in southeastern Colorado. ""We're making Herculean efforts to get into all planner with the Colorado Office of Emergency Management."" At least one death was blamed on the storm. An unattended candle in a house without power started a fire that killed one woman in Omaha, Neb; it took firefighters about a half-hour to reach the house because of the weather. The blizzard that blew through the Rockies and onto the Plains on Saturday left more than a metre of snow in the Colorado Rockies, 56 centimetres in parts of Denver and 89 centimetres in the city's suburbs. The storm moved eastward yesterday and snow fell from eastern Kansas through Missouri and Iowa into Wisconsin and eastern Michigan. Heavy snow had fallen in Utah on Friday and flakes fell as far south as the Texas Panhandle on Saturday."
"What specific actions were taken to address the power outage caused by the accident during the blizzard, and what timeline is provided for the restoration of electricity in the city?","The city had sufficient shelter space to accommodate more than 1,000 people last night and was prepared to open more centres if necessary. ""It is an emergency situation, and we are under what we call a pre-alert,"" said city spokesman Michel Ouellet. ""That means we have not launched the full emergency plan, but we are prepared to do so if necessary."" Ouellet said that plan would only be activated if, for example, an entire neighbourhood were destroyed by fire and needed to be evacuated, or hospitals were without power. He said these scenarios are very unlikely during an ice storm. He added the city will not ask to be declared a disaster zone, which only happens when municipal authorities are unable to assure the safety of their residents. In fact, Ouellet said, the city is coping well with the ice-storm problems. Snow-removal operations began on the Plateau Mont Royal and downtown on Tuesday, and in the rest of the city at 7 a.m. yesterday. The city is asking motorists to respect temporary parking restriction signs. Two fires were started yesterday because of residents using candles to light their homes. City authorities urged residents not to improvise with heating sources and to be very careful with candle lighting.","They also begin to make regular calls to the premier's office.

For about 500 miles north of the international boundary line along the Peace River to the Great Slave Lake, the land for the most part is rich and fertile, and on account of the warm southwest winds which sweep along the slopes and through the passes of the Rocky Mountains, the climate is temperate for a great part of the year. In many districts round the Hudson's Bay posts and the missionary stations there are the nuclei of settlements, and in connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway, now in course of construction, the entire country has been thoroughly explored by scientific men and practical agriculturists, who have ascertained beyond doubt that it contains fine pasturage and at least two hundred million acres of the finest wheat land in the world.

Yet such intense cold did not mean that Lt. Warburton caught a cold, nor did he come down with influenza. After such nights he was up and on his snowshoes and ready to tramp for miles. The cold, so far from inducing illness, acted as a tonic. He described those invigorating days: Though one of the extremely cold days, there was nothing painful in the sensations; the air was thin and pure as on a mountain top; everything was bright and cheerful: the fresh snow, crisped by the severe frost, supported the snowshoe on its very surface, while we felt light and vigorous, and capable of unusual exertion. Those who returned with health invigorated by such experiences of the cold found themselves overflowing with health. But soon after re-entering towns or cities, living indoors in overheated atmospheres and among other people, they were seized by colds or influenza. They became infected, whereas out in the intense cold they never had been."
"What specific agricultural impact did the recent floods have on farming districts in the German Empire, as described in the passage?","Minnesota has had severe blizzards and with the most favorable weather spring seeding will be very late. The trying March weather has also lightened the prospects of the anticipated large average of oats. Last year the bulk of the crop was seeded at this date, while this year nothing has been done. Further backward weather will tend to greatly cut the crop of oats short. In California seeding is practically over, and conditions are generally good. Texas has had abundant rains, and promises the finest crop of winter wheat in her history, in Tennessee and Kentucky the promising crop has been seriously injured by the Minnesota blizzard. The same is true, only more so, in the wheat centers of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Michigan has been more protected by snow, and in Kansas the prospect is good. Crops are suffering only from lack of reserves of moisture. Missouri promises a fair average crop. Canada has been well protected, and her present condition is all that could be desired. In most of the flooded districts of Germany the water continues to rise, and the indications are that the lands now submerged will remain so for at least a month.

The retreating waves left hundreds of square miles thickly covered with mud and debris; thousands of trees were torn out by the roots and swept away; houses, by the hundred, were ruined, and many families rendered homeless and destitute, having lost everything in the vast deluge; and, saddest of all, hundreds of human lives were lost in noble attempts to save other lives and property from destruction. Several bridges in the flooded districts gave way before the great weight of those assembled on them, anxiously watching the rising of the water in the rivers, and few persons only could be saved from among the turbulent waves and mass of floating debris. THE LOSS OF LIFE is variously estimated to be from 1,700 to 3,000, and more than 30,000 persons are rendered homeless. The damage done to property, as far as can be ascertained, amounts to 80 millions of marks ($20,000,000).

The London correspondent of the Times cables: A week ago it was felt that the weather in England since the beginning of June had already become a too grotesquely ridiculous thing to be discussed in ordinary language. Since then there has been the heaviest rainfall known in any one week since 1878, and the whole six weeks' record is the worst since 1813. To have to go back nearly eighty years for a parallel affords the Briton a sort of gloomy pride in the unique character of this summer, but not even Mark Tapley could pretend to comfort in its contemplation. The havoc this continuous downpour has worked in the fashionable world of regattas, lawn fetes and riverside parties is of no lasting consequence, but the direct pecuniary loss to farmers has become something terrible. I came in this morning from Shepperton, some twenty miles up the river, and saw literally a hundred acres of meadows in which cocked hay was four-fifths under water."

How has the continued drought in the western district of Victoria specifically affected the quality and quantity of the wool clip as reported in the Boston Wool Market passage?,"The market has been more active than a week ago, the sales exceeding those by 371,720 lbs. This business has been done very quietly, and the tone of the market is one of disappointment from a dealer's standpoint. The main feature has been heavy transactions in territory wools, which have ruled rather lower from the highest prices. Better prices have been obtained for Ohio XX and above, the scarcity of choice lots of which is more marked, and prices in Ohio are very strong. The anxiety noted a week ago as to credits in the trade continues, and the market has been well stocked with rumors which are yet without any furious foundation. The London market, since the closing of the colonial quarterly sale, has been dull. The Australian mail of the week brought advices reporting that shearing was then (about September 4) in progress in the northern districts and parts of Riverina. A few lots of the new clip had also arrived in Melbourne. The continued drought has caused heavy losses of sheep in the western district of Victoria, and a large portion of the clip will be tender and badly grown.

The market has been ready more of a dealers' than a manufacturers' market. The advance in London has been so great, and so sharp, that manufacturers do not fully realize its importance, while dealers, quick to appreciate the influence of events upon merchandise, are not only reluctant sellers but active buyers. The outlook for the new clips in Buenos Ayres and Australia is poor. In the former, the drought has killed off a great many sheep, of which no actual statistics can be obtained, but it is surely a heavy one. Then, as to the Australian clip, the reports indicate that it is very poor in length and strength of staple, owing to the excessive drought. The advance in fine wools in London and Antwerp is such that manufactured goods must advance on the other side, and already we hear of contracts being repudiated by manufacturers there. Montevideo wool would now bring on the other side 20c-22c, and 20c in bond has been offered and refused here.","23,200 48,299 78,599 BOSTON WOOL MARKET Boston, October 13, The total receipts of wool at this port during the past week comprise 9,407 bales domestic and 4,219 foreign, against 10,079 bales domestic and 1,767 foreign for the same time last year.

It is said, effectively done. The music was that of the flute, the measure being of a slow and mournful character. The crop reports from the stations along the line of the Manitoba and Northwestern railway, running a hundred and thirty miles northwesterly from Portage la Prairie, bear out the favorable advices received from other sources of the prospects of the coming harvest in the Northwest. Condition most promising, looking splendid, excellent condition, farmers well pleased indicates the tone of the advices from the important wheat-growing area served by this road. Everything, it may be said, promises for the best. All that is required is that the weather for the next three weeks or so should be favorable, as it has been since the 16th inst., the date of the reports, the thermometer at Winnipeg during the day marking well up among the 80s.","It was not till 1881 that the unjust restriction was removed and land grants were issued. The fishery question proper still, however, remained and notwithstanding repeated attempts at a solution, a definitive satisfactory settlement has ever been arrived at. The annexation of Newfoundland would also necessitate a favorable arrangement with the United States and would add considerably to the advantage of Canada's position in dealing with that power. But before entering into such an arrangement, it is of the utmost importance to have the French controversy settled and done with. THE ""ICO rS AND THE FAD. It is apparent from the August report of the Ontario Bureau of Statistics that the harvest in that province will be very much larger than at one time seemed probable. Unusually rains in the latter part of July and beginning of August have recovered the drought-parched crops in the Midland district to a considerable extent, and given a luxuriant growth to the grain in other sections more favorably situated, and although the harvest will not be surpassingly bountiful it will vastly exceed that of last year and give a full average yield."

Mr.","CHOI'S IN MANITOBA - Vegetation Retarded by Heat Drought - The Condition Generally Encouraging - WINNIPEG, July 10 The crop correspondents of the Manitoba Department of Agriculture are now sending in replies to the second series of questions addressed to them during the current season. A large number of reports have already been received at the department, many of which show that the dry weather of the past few weeks has been a serious drawback to the crops in this province, and that the bright prospects offered in the early part of June have not been fully realized. Coupled with the drought, the heat has been excessive and vegetation has consequently been much retarded. Considering both those serious drawbacks, the condition of the crops in most instances is encouraging. Though no rains have been general for some time, still a number of local showers fell which had the effect of preserving the crops from more serious results than otherwise would have been the case. Of the several crops, the wheat crop is generally at this date in the most flourishing condition. This is owing to the fact that it was sown at a very early date, and that the great bulk of the crop was put in on ground prepared last season.

Father Smith, of the Society of Priests of Mercy, popularly known as the Fathers of Mercy, a native of Ottawa, left here for Brooklyn on Saturday after a visit to his mother and family. The reverend gentleman has had a unique experience recently. He had been seriously ill and fell into a trance which was taken for death and the news of his demise was wired to his family. While lying awaiting interment he fully realized the preparations that were going on around him, but was unable for a considerable time to signify that he was still living. Happily, however, he recovered and among others who called upon him to congratulate him was a brother priest who had been summoned from another city to preach his funeral sermon.","A severe drought has prevailed during the whole season with the result of checking the growth of crops of all kinds. Peas, oats and fall wheat are fair, but other crops are below an average. Nai'ankk, Ont, July 9, Hay is very light, old meadows very bad; grain fair crop; clay land very light. Dry weather has almost ruined some fields, but others are looking fairly well. With occasional showers from this out grain will be an average crop. Cayuga, Ont, July 9, Crops in this vicinity have suffered much from the drought. Hay will be about a quarter crop. Wheat will be better than a half crop and is a good sample. Wheat suffered much from the frost in May. Oats and barley and peas are looking fairly well. A few showers will make peas a good crop. Wilkesland, Ont, July 9, Hay short and very poor except some new meadows, which are fair. Wheat is fair, oats poor, very few good pieces. Corn is doing pretty well, being able to stand the drought. Potatoes and root crop prospects are fair, although if the drought continues they will suffer."
"What specific actions has Helgeson, the state commissioner of agriculture, taken to address the unprecedented suffering due to drought in the newer portion of the state, and what assistance is being sought for the provisions, clothing, fuel, and feed for stock in these counties?","Victoria is looking up and New Westminster is full of hope and enterprise. The lumber, mining and shipping interests of the Pacific coast have all shown life and steady progress. The fisheries have advanced even more notably, there being a regular boom in the salmon canning industry. The only serious drawback, and as Mr. Prior pointed out, it is one which has well nigh exhausted the patience of those concerned, is the complicated state of the sealing question. In no respect has the progress of the Northwest been more gratifying than in the extension of its railways and the inception of new lines in various directions. Since 1882 so much activity has not been witnessed. On no less than seven lines has construction been going on in Manitoba, besides two in the Territories. Fifty miles of new road connect Winnipeg and Portage la Prairie, and 145 have been built from Morris to Brandon, through the centre of the Province. Northwest from Brandon fifty miles more have been completed. The C","Reports received from many points in Ontario indicate that fall wheat will be hardly an average crop, much of it having been winter killed. Spring wheat will, it is believed, be slightly over the average. Oats have not done well and will be short. If barley is a fair crop, it is all it will be. Hay is a failure. Peas are reported to be average. Roots and fruit are good, live is in many places but half a crop.

There were only 68,000 barrels made, against 61,208 barrels the previous week, and 130,000 barrels for the corresponding time in 1887.

What specific health risk does the passage mention for anglers exposed to the wind-chill on the ice of Montreal-area waters?,"Automobile access to the ice is generally by way of an access ramp created and maintained by the outfitter, usually across his own property. Hence the outfitter has every right to impose a toll on all cars going on the ice; prices range from $2 per vehicle to the same amount per person in the vehicle. Most outfitters sell bait at the access ramp. If you're fully equipped, the access fee and the cost of the minnows is all you'll have to pay. On the other hand, if you rent cabins, figure on the daily rental fee and, in some cases, rentals of tip-ups and a fee for drilling the holes. The advantage of renting an ice-fishing cabin is that you have a warm shelter from the cold and the wind, an important consideration if you're taking youngsters. The disadvantage is that you'll be fishing over an area that's been fished the day before and the day before that. Worse, if the fishing is poor, it's tough to relocate since few outfitters are keen on constantly switching anglers from one area to another, especially on busy weekends.","director of client services for the Laval Transit Corp, said 20 per cent of the bus routes were cancelled because of icy bridge conditions while buses on the remaining runs were delayed by 45 to 50 minutes Doris Drouin, administrative assistant with the Montreal South Shore Transit Corp, said buses were behind schedule by approximately 45 minutes on most routes yesterday morning She said one of the major problems was that the reserved bus lane on the Champlain Bridge was closed because of ice ""It was a very difficult morning,"" Drouin said Montreal Urban Community Transit Corp buses were five to 12 minutes late on their morning runs and Metro rush hour service was extended by an hour in the morning and again in the afternoon, official Jean-Yves Duthel said Montreal streets were cleared of snow and ice by mid-afternoon, the communications co-ordinator for the city public works department said Susan Ellefsen said the city's snow removal crews were on the ready at 3 a m and went to work at 5 a m when 2.5 cm of snow had fallen ""There was less snow than we had expected,"" she said Lagace, a weather specialist with Environment Canada,","The advantage of renting an ice-fishing cabin is that you have a warm shelter from the cold and the wind, an important consideration if you're taking youngsters.

Worse, if the fishing is poor, it's tough to relocate since few outfitters are keen on constantly switching anglers from one area to another, especially on busy weekends. Whether you're an avid or casual ice-fisherman, you should have a complete grasp of the phenomenon of wind chill since, next to the danger of thin ice, it's the greatest risk winter anglers face. It becomes a danger even when the thermometer is above the freezing mark and, at temperatures of minus-18 C, exposed skin will freeze in minutes. In order to measure the effects of the wind-chill phenomenon and provide a guideline for people working outdoors in winter conditions, the military developed a wind-chill index. It essentially works on the premise of temperature equivalency, providing a gauge to the combined effect of wind and cold on living tissue. At a given temperature, the stronger the wind, the more it leaches warmth away from the exposed area."

Six people were airlifted by helicopter from the Sea Hawk when the 120-metre ship was trapped near a rocky island in the Bay of Islands area. ""She's got two anchors down in the ice and there's no problem whatsoever,"" said a spokesman from the Search and Rescue Centre in Halifax.

They have to be encouraged. Bourque pledges better services AARON DERFEL Gazette Civic Affairs Reporter Mayor Pierre Bourque conceded yesterday that snow removal has suffered under his administration but he blamed the problems on blue-collar workers and bad weather. Still, he pledged to improve snow-clearing and other services should he be re-elected. At the same time, he ruled out the idea of charging for services based on consumption. What I can tell Montrealers is that we will do everything to improve the performance of our workers, he said during a meeting with The Gazette's editorial board. Bourque has come under sharp criticism for cutting funding to essential services like libraries and mass transit while imposing user fees on recreational activities. During the campaign, he has preferred to dwell on his economic-development record, pointing out that he hasn't raised property taxes. Yesterday, however, Bourque addressed the issue of services head-on. He admitted snow removal was weak last winter and in 1997 but he said the problem was beyond his control. He argued that the overtime strike by blue-collar workers in 1997 slowed snow removal. The blue collars are responsible for half the city's snow-clearing."
"What are the potential economic and ecological impacts on Quebec if the St. Lawrence Seaway's water levels decrease, specifically regarding the role of Montreal as a port and the movement of the salt-water front affecting water nitration plants?","Please see ISRAEL, Page A2 Candidate loved his pranks Page B1 Celebrating a successful march MARCOS TOWNSEND, GAZETTE Jay Wiseman (right), 79, dances to music with friend Tatyana Kaplan during festivities outside Cavendish Mall after the 27th annual March to Jerusalem yesterday. Wiseman, who didn't participate in the march, saved her energy for the party. Story, Page A3 SHIPPING THREATENED Water level far too low, panel says UYEN VU The Gazette Drinking water in some areas could be in short supply and ships might not be able to navigate the St. Lawrence Seaway if warm temperatures persist and rainfall stays low, a government panel warned yesterday. The low water levels particularly threaten ships using the Port of Montreal, where water tables have decreased more drastically than elsewhere in the Great Lakes basin. ""Probably later this summer, we'll have problems in the Port of Montreal and all the parts of the Seaway, for commercial shipping,"" said Fabien Lengelle, spokesman for the International Joint Commission.","That's because smaller cities don't have pipes that go deep into the lakes or the Seaway to draw the water, he explained. Stephane Gingras, a spokesman for the cross-border environmental group Great Lakes United, said low water levels also threaten water quality. Movement in the shallower water can stir up toxins deposited in the bottom and contaminate drinking water. Lengelle acknowledged that whenever levels drop, Montreal-area residents might look on the commission's level controls with suspicion. ""There's a feeling in Montreal that we probably would keep the water on the lake to protect the interests of Toronto, Rochester and these cities, but I have to say that it's a balancing act. Montreal is definitely a big interest,"" Lengelle said. When levels dropped last fall, he said, the commission raised the outflow from Lake Ontario to mitigate the impact on the Port of Montreal. The commission might issue another such order this time, he added. Lengelle said it's too soon to tell whether the low waters are part of a trend resulting from global warming. ""It's part of a cycle. We had very high waters in the 1990s.","Its 25 recommendations focus, among other things, on securing safe drinking water for all Canadians, responding to climate change, and promoting a culture of water conservation. Debunking the myth of limitless water is a starting point. We have this tendency to just turn on our taps and think, 'Well, there's an endless supply there,' said Morris of the Sierra Club. But it's coming from somewhere and it's having an impact. Our water resources are not infinite and they do have a point where they're going to end up in trouble unless we do a better job of stewarding them. DAVE SIDAWAY GAZETTE FILE PHOTO Already, marinas on the St. Lawrence say there's an increase in pleasure boats hitting rocks. Climate change is part of the answer but the studies are not conclusive that it's the only cause, Hudon said. It could be a natural cycle but it's one we've never seen before. In the future, a drop in Great Lakes water levels could cause levels in the St. Lawrence to fall by up to one metre in some areas, Environment Canada says. In such a scenario, Montreal would not be the only city clamoring for Great Lakes water."

When a leader is in trouble, it's a good idea to surround him with the team as the Conservatives have done with Stephen Harper in a series of four television ads that have been running since late August in Battleground Ontario. The 30-second spots might not succeed in changing voters' minds about Harper, but they might create a comfort level with the Conservative team. The Team Tory theme also plays to competence, another key attribute that moves voters. The topics of the ads reveal a welcome shift of emphasis from divisive issues like same-sex marriage. Of the four spots, only one, on taxes, is a core Conservative message to the party's base. The others - on accrediting immigrants' professional skills, child care and health care - are aimed at broadening the Conservatives' appeal in urban Ontario. While the ads aren't running in Quebec, they can be viewed at the party's website (www.conservative.ca), which is a story in itself.

Crane established a farm on the north side of Lakeshore Rd and built a lakefront mansion known as the Knoll.

For 18 years, the Fathers supported themselves by cultivating the farm while training several generations of lay brothers, missionaries and priests in an atmosphere of isolation from the community around them. But by 1958, the order could no longer support itself and sold the property to real-estate developers.

""There is potential for several more storms at least as powerful as those that occurred last year,"" John Kappenman, a transmission planning engineer at Minnesota Power in Duluth who co-authored the Spectrum article, said in a telephone interview. Kappenman co-wrote the article based on information supplied by Hydro-Quebec and other sources. Hydro's system is particularly vulnerable, he noted, because of its northern location, close to auroral electrojets electrical currents of up to one million amperes orbiting the earth's electromagnetic poles. Hydro's transmission system is also weakened by its location on the Laurentian shield, whose rocky structure resists, rather than absorbs, the geomagnetic voltages. The remoteness of the transmission lines, some extending more than 1,000 kilometres from their load centres, also makes the system vulnerable. Kappenman noted that Hydro's plan to install series capacitors, which compensate for surges in transmission lines, should do a very good job in blocking other current flows induced by geomagnetic storms.","But Hydro-Quebec engineers say they have already taken corrective measures that make it extremely unlikely that such a massive power breakdown would recur. The geomagnetic storm struck the province March 13 at 2:45 a.m. after a gigantic flare erupted from a large sunspot area around the eastern rim of the sun. This eruption sent a massive blast of X-rays and electrically charged particles toward earth, overloading transmission lines in northern Quebec and shutting down Hydro-Quebec's transmission grid. An article in this month's Spectrum, the journal of the U.S. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, suggests that last year's sunspot was part of a cycle that is expected to peak by next year.

What specific infrastructure in Manila is affected by the Mount Pinatubo explosion as described in the passage?,"Warships yesterday at Subic Bay Naval Station and departed for Cebu, about 560 km from Manila, where they were scheduled to board planes for the United States. Even as the evacuation order was issued, Philippine volcano scientists said that the worst of Mount Pinatubo's eruptions may be over, despite a prediction on Saturday that the volcano was on the verge of a major explosion. The scientists said that much of the pressure built up in the volcano had dissipated this weekend in the emission of vast clouds of ash and rock that turned day to night across the island of Luzon, and in a series of earthquakes, including one that rocked skyscrapers in central Manila yesterday. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology scaled back the official danger zone around the volcano from 40 to 30 km. ""For this episode, the worst is over,"" said the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Scientists said yesterday that it appeared that a section of the crater on Mount Pinatubo had collapsed on itself, releasing pressure that might otherwise have produced a cataclysmic avalanche of molten rock.","Warships yesterday at Subic Bay Naval Station and departed for Cebu, about 560 km from Manila, where they were scheduled to board planes for the United States.

Hundreds of American-built homes have been stripped bare; toilets and plumbing were torn out, light fixtures and windows removed, wires ripped from punched-out walls. Dormant for six centuries, Pinatubo erupted with increasing fury last year. The monstrous June 15 explosion pumped ash high into the atmosphere and is believed to have changed world weather patterns, even cooling off the global warming trend. Pinatubo began erupting again this July 14 and has now built a lava dome 1,200 feet long and 950 feet wide. It sits inside a crater more than a mile across and nearly 2000 feet deep where the mountain summit once stood. Hundreds of tremors a day deep inside the volcano indicate that molten rock is again forcing its way to the surface. Erupt again If it continues, we can expect another explosive eruption, said volcanologist Jaime Sinsioco, who works in a converted Clark office filled with computers and seismic recorders and a telescope trained on the still-smoking volcano.

The primary difference between the two types of volcano is the amount of underground water present and gases dissolved in the magma, or liquid rock. If there is little gas or water, the magma will flow out almost sedately. But if there is a lot of water, the eruption will be explosive and large quantities of ash will be ejected into the atmosphere. Although researchers call the ejecta ash, it really isn't the type of burned material that most people associate with the word. Rather, it is very fine-grained rock and glass. Because the particles are formed by explosive stress fractures, they tend to be very sharp-edged. When humans and animals inhale them, they can damage the air passages. And when they are sucked in by a jet engine, they can shut the engine down. In 1918, ""there was ash up to people's shoulders.""","Thousands of nearby villagers, many jarred from sleep by rumblings before the pre-dawn eruption, boarded army trucks to leave the area. Evacuees crammed into school classrooms and some took refuge under trees in the schoolyard. No injuries were reported. The Mayon volcano's eruption began with lava gushing out of the crater, accompanied by loud rumblings some nearby residents compared with thunder. Lava with temperatures that reached well above 538 degrees C cascaded 5.5 kilometres down the mountain's near-perfect conical slopes. Ash rained as far as 10 kilometres away. Fourteen explosions were recorded by late afternoon, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said. The fiercest sent ash flying 7 kilometres into the air and spread it across the sky, darkening some villages and forcing cars to use their headlights at midday. GRIM WARNINGS Officials warned a more violent explosion could occur any time. The area is most vulnerable to lava, falling rocks and deadly pyroclastic flows - superheated clouds of volcanic ash that travel up to 80 kilometres an hour and can instantly incinerate anything in their path."

Meteorologists said Hurricane Andrew would strike the coast at dawn today with winds of about 240 kilometres an hour. ""This is a killer storm.","""It got pretty hairy for a little while,"" Stewart Beck said from his home in the trendy Coconut Grove neighborhood of south Miami.

The worst damage was in southern Dade County between the Miami suburb of Kendall and the Florida Keys.

The cabinet made no decision on the plans, and no cabinet meetings are scheduled until August.","A search dog found the first body and searchers with long poles found the three other bodies shortly afterward. ""I assume they were hiking up to make a run because of the way we found the evidence,"" said George Field, the public-safety specialist for Kananaskis Country, who helped in the search. ""They were all walking fairly close together and propagated the slope above them and were swept down the mountain."" Anglo health access 'no problem' Rochon says plan delayed again ELIZABETH THOMPSON Gazette Quebec Bureau QUEBEC - Health Minister Jean Rochon said yesterday that the adoption of new English-language health-access plans has once again been delayed, in part as a result of Health Department staff changeovers. He said regional boards have been asked to revise the plans they had originally submitted. He now expects them to go to the cabinet sometime in the first three months of the new year. But he said the delay in adopting new access plans for English health care is not a problem because anglophones can be served in English in any hospital in Quebec. ""Let's face it, there is no problem now in the health-and-social-service establishments to have access to services in English. The new plan will just confirm and consolidate the situation."
"What method does Hydro-Quebec rely on to determine if windblown branches have knocked out power lines serving a small percentage of their clients, and how does this impact the time customers wait for repairs?","David Birnbaum, executive director of Alliance Quebec, said the delay means the English community is left without effective access plans, since the 1989 plans now in effect were drawn up long before the massive changes to Quebec's health-care system. When lightning strikes, they're ready to repair damage total, blamed on thunderstorms. Levasseur said the amount of time it takes for power to be restored to an area depends on the circumstances of the blackout. Levasseur acknowledged that however sophisticated the utility's damage-control policies become for dealing with lightning, so far there's been no breakthrough in the war against freezing rain, which left some North Shore Hydro customers without electricity for days last winter. He said the utility is working on a system that could monitor the weight of freezing rain forming on power lines, but the technology was not yet in use across the power distribution network. Lightning is a source of energy Hydro-Quebec cannot harness, and it is expected once again to blackout homes across the province this summer, as thunderstorms roll across southern Quebec. The lightning-tracking system might look impressive, but it only allows the utility to make an educated guess about where to deploy its repair crews.","David Birnbaum, executive director of Alliance Quebec, said the delay means the English community is left without effective access plans, since the 1989 plans now in effect were drawn up long before the massive changes to Quebec's health-care system.

Rene Perreault, an official with Quebec's Public Security Department, said he expected the situation to worsen over the coming days. ""We don't want to be alarmist but it's becoming very serious,"" he said. While the more than 60 emergency shelters set up around the province Tuesday were operating well below capacity yesterday, Perreault said emergency workers are anticipating a flood of storm refugees. ""A lot of people have chosen to remain in their homes."" This is a very worrying situation. The ice that is on the trees won't have a chance to thaw, and we are expecting another 20 to 30 mm.

Tree crews were busy trying to clear debris from smaller wires, and identify exactly where the breaks have occurred. Crocepti said priority is being given to public institutions like hospitals and old-age homes, followed by city services, airports, police and fire stations, and communications businesses. Customers living in strictly residential neighborhoods are at the bottom of the list. ""Localized breaks are repaired last,"" said Crocepti."

The second storm hit about 6 p.m. yesterday but was less intense; Winds were recorded at 55 kilometres per hour, half the velocity of the day before. But Hydro-Québec said yesterday's rain hampered repair works. About 10 p.m. yesterday, 6,000 homes still had no power, mostly in Dollard des Ormeaux, Pierrefonds, Roxboro, L'Île-Bizard, Town of Mount Royal, Outremont and St. Laurent. Many of these homes have had no electricity since Thursday's storm. The weather hit harder in other parts of Quebec yesterday. In Granby, high winds knocked down trees and blew shingles from rooftops, while hail fell on Trois-Rivières. Across Montreal island yesterday, residents totted up damages left by the first storm. For Andrea Selinger, the drive home from her downtown office to her Outremont home during Thursday's flash storm was eerie."
"What specific human health impact of thunder-related events is highlighted in the passage, and how does it compare to other natural disasters in terms of fatalities in North America?","Picnickers in areas where there is no shelter nearby should get into a car or crouch down in some low-lying area, such as a ravine; health officials advise. A car affords some protection, as long as you are not touching any metal surfaces. Hit indoors: In some instances, lightning has hit people indoors. The current can travel along an antenna or television cable, hitting people standing close to a TV. It also can hit telephone lines, causing a deafening sound for someone on the phone, but not actually strike the caller. When the lightning bolt lets go, a stream of ions searches out a channel through the air toward ground; at the same time, the electrical charge on the ground will actually reach up to the descending bolt. The temperature of the bolt instantly reaches 50,000 degrees F (27,760 C). The power in a lightning bolt averages 100 million volts. If the bolt hits a person directly it is usually fatal. More often, it is a glancing blow, sometimes called a lightning splash, that first hits a tree, for example, and then strikes a person. The electricity can jump off the tree and flow into the person, or it can travel through the ground and up into a body.","Summer must: ""Walking everywhere.

The shocking truth about lightning. HOW LIGHTNING WORKS: Lightning is caused by the attraction between positive and negative charges in the atmosphere, resulting in the buildup and discharge of electrical energy. This rapid heating and cooling of the air produces the shock wave that results in thunder. During a storm, raindrops can acquire extra electrons, which are negatively charged. These surplus electrons seek out a positive charge from the ground.","Normally, the earth itself is negatively charged, but the negative charge at the bottom of the cloud induces the earth's surface to become positively charged. Sometimes people near where the bolt is about to hit will sense the change in electrical charge along the ground. Their skin will tingle and their hair will float up as though attracted by static electricity. If you feel such an electrical tingling, put your feet together and crouch down to make yourself as small a target as possible."
